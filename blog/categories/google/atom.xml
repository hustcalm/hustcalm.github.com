    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I happened to get to know <code>Google Webmaster Tools</code>, <code>Google Analytics</code> and <code>Google Authorship Markup</code> when I try to tweak my <code>Octopress</code> website. Found that Google is really doing lots of interesting things for our websites, I will share some useful tips and links here.</p>

<h3>Google Webmaster Tools</h3>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Official Webmasters</a> to get started, first try to look around to know what <code>Webmasters</code> aims to do.

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

<p>Even better, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> will let you know every single click from users to your website. See <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/features/index.html">Analytics features</a> for complete lists to know what <code>Analytics</code> can do. Initially set up for commercial use or marketing promotion, we can adapt this technique to our personal website.</p>

<p>Also, look carefully about <code>your website report</code>, I bet you will find something interesting. For developers, there are <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/?csw=1">Developer Guides &amp; Reference for Google Analytics</a>.</p>

<h3>Google Authorship</h3>

<p>Well, it would be cool to attribute the article or post to its author, <a href="https://plus.google.com/authorship">Google Authorship</a> is the one who helps.</p>

<p>See the professional article <a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-definitive-guide-to-google-authorship-markup-123218">The Definitive Guide To Google Authorship Markup</a> for details. To test if you have successfully set your authorship, use <a href="www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">Google Structured Data Testing
Tool</a>.</p>

<p>As for me, I verified my authorship through my Email related to my domain bought from <a href="https://name.com">name.com</a>. Simple Enable <code>Email Service</code> through the domain dashboard, you can set up a forward Email for your owned domain Email address.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Google FeedBurner</h3>

<p><a href="http://feedburner.google.com">FeedBurner</a> is a service for <code>RSS</code> subscribe. It&rsquo;s flexible enough and ease your pain when switching domains.</p>

<p>After you add your blog to feedburner, it supports <code>RSS readers</code> by default. So if you want your readers to subscribe through their Emails, go to your feeds and click <code>Publicize</code>, then click <code>Email Subscriptions</code>, down the page to click <code>Active</code> to make the service alive.</p>

<p>See other tabs of your feeds, there are really lots of for you to tweak and play with.</p>

<hr />

<p>When you find blogging more interesting and part of your life, it&rsquo;s time to give an eye for your website status and traffic. I used to blog for just expressing myself, but now I also tend to write something that readers would enjoy.</p>

<p>Hope this post would get you to know with the Google tools that you can use and make you a better blogger:&ndash;)</p>
