    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After being the reviewer for the <a href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/02/10/review-of-beaglebone-robotic-projects-from-a-technical-perspective/">BeagleBone Robotic Projects</a>, I&rsquo;m honored to be the reviewer for another book about robotic projects named <a href="http://bit.ly/1hrlCQP">Raspberry Pi Robotic Projects</a>. I will go no further to talk about the differences about <code>BeagleBone</code> and <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, all I know is that they are both cool and amazing. To start to play with <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, I suggest that you
can list the book <a href="http://bit.ly/1hrlCQP">Raspberry Pi Robotics Projects</a> as an option.</p>

<p>In this post, I will give you a very quick overview of the book and tell why it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Getting Started with Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>Have no idea what is really <code>Raspberry Pi</code>? Well, just treat it as your <code>Mini Computer</code>. The truth is, it got almost everything what a PC should be equipped with. What&rsquo;s more, it runs Linux which means you can do tons of things with it!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, <code>Raspberry Pi</code> is leading the <code>open hardware community</code> somehow, people design, manufacture, develop and play. Geeks use it for their geek life!</p>

<p>In <strong>chapter 1</strong>, you will be informed the hardware and software of <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and begin to be friends with her.</p>

<h4>Programming Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>As you want to make <code>Raspberry Pi</code> do something really amazing, you should know how to talk to her. Well, you program to talk. So in <strong>chapter 2</strong>, we will show you how to get comfortable with the way <code>talking(programming)</code>. Besides to knowing <code>Linux</code>, use <code>Python</code> and <code>C/C++</code> is cool:&ndash;)</p>

<h4>Providing Speech Input and Output</h4>

<p>What? You want to talk to her, really. I mean by <code>speaking</code>. Well, that should not be problem. Let&rsquo;s give our robot <code>ears</code> and <code>mouth</code>. <strong>Chapter 3</strong> will show you how to use <code>PocketSphinx</code> to accept your voice commands and utilize <code>Espeak</code> to make <code>Raspberry Pi</code> talk in a robot voice.</p>

<h4>Adding Vision to Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>How can a beautiful girl be blind! So to make <code>Rasberry Pi</code> see the amazing world, <strong>chapter 4</strong> will tell you how to connect the USB cemara to <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and begin to use <code>OpenCV</code>, which is a fully featured vision library to detect colored objects.</p>

<h4>Creating Mobile Robots on Wheels</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s roll! To see the beatiful world around, we need to make our robot able to move. <strong>Chapter 5</strong> will show you how to add motor controller to <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and let her run at free will.</p>

<h4>Making the Unit Very Mobile &ndash; Controlling the Movement of a Robot with Legs</h4>

<p>A girl should really walk, doesn&rsquo;t it? No problem, <strong>chapter 6</strong> tells how to get started with <code>servos</code> and make your mobile platform truly mobile just as a person.</p>

<h4>Avoiding Obstacles Using Sensors</h4>

<p>Oh, there is a wall in front, danger! Don&rsquo;t worry, our <code>Raspberry Pi</code> knows everything and will avoid it easily. <strong>Chapter 7</strong> shows how to use an <code>infrared sensor</code> and <code>USB sonar sensor</code> with <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, also how to use a <code>servo</code> to move a single sensor to make our sening range large enough.</p>

<h4>Going Truly Mobile &ndash; The Remote Control of Your Robot</h4>

<p>You will not always be around with your <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, right? To make sure your <code>Pi</code> is always with you, <strong>Chapter 8</strong> demonstrates how to connect wireless devices to <code>Pi</code> thus enabling us to talk to her remotely. Use a <code>wireless USB keyboard</code>, or <code>a wireless LAN</code> or <code>a ZigBee device</code>, choose as you like.</p>

<h4>Using a GPS Receiver to Locate Your Robot</h4>

<p>No one wants to be told that his <code>Raspberry Pi</code> is lost. Fortunately, we got <code>GPS</code> nowadays for almost free. Connecting <code>Raspberry Pi</code> to a <code>GPS</code> device and accessing the <code>GPS</code> programmatically is mainly covered in <strong>chapter 9</strong>.</p>

<h4>System Dynamics</h4>

<p>Get tired with so much coding for each dedicated task? <strong>Chaper 10</strong> will free you from hell by creating a general control structure. Also you can enable complex functionalities by using the structure of the <code>Robot Operating System</code>.</p>

<h4>By Land, Sea, and Air</h4>

<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t just want a <code>Raspbery Pi</code>, you really want is a <code>Quadrotor</code>, or a <code>submarine</code> or a <code>mini ship</code>! Nothing is impossible, <strong>Chapter 11</strong> will be a good starting point to creat something really amazing.</p>

<p>I hope that you like <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and the book will do some good. Happy playing and hakcing with <code>Raspberry Pi</code>!!!</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/04/17/build-ptam-on-fedora-20-the-easy-way-10-minutes-tutorial/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-17T19:21:41+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/04/17/build-ptam-on-fedora-20-the-easy-way-10-minutes-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since the last post <a href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/09/27/ptam-compilation-on-linux-howto/">PTAM Compilation on Linux-HowTo</a> about playing with PTAM. And now Isis Innovation has released the source code under GPLv3 and put it on <a href="https://github.com/Oxford-PTAM/PTAM-GPL">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Last time, we demostrate detailed instructions on how to get PTAM running on Debian derived systems(Linux Mint 15 and Ubuntu 12.04), now I want talk about building the source code on Fedora 20. It won&rsquo;t be long, since I just want to talk about the key components, thus the mandatory dependencies(<strong>TooN, libCVD, Gvars3, OpenGL, libjpeg, libpng, libtiff</strong>, etc).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As the PTAM source code use the GNU autoconf tools, so the typical way to install is <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code>, however, to make sure that certain third libs are correctly configured and can found when running <code>configure</code>, you may want to have a look at the output after <code>configure</code> and install any key dependency which is missed.</p>

<p>Whenever you are not sure, see the <strong>Official Website</strong> for sure!!!</p>

<h2>Install Dependencies</h2>

<h3>TooN</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/toon.html">TooN</a> is a numerics library used by libCVD. Since they are just a bundle of header files, installation is trivial.</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install liblapack-devel
sudo yum install libblas-devel

./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h3>libCVD</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/">libCVD</a> is a very portable and high performance C++ library for computer vision, image, and video processing.</p>

<p>This is the key component for building PTAM, thus should be careful. Make sure you installed OpenGL correctly, also for the video source, if you are using a UVC webcam, check if <code>v4l2</code> is working. Or if you are using a IEEE1394 camera, get libxx1394 series libs installed which can drive your camera. For Image I/O, always have libjpeg, libpng and libtiff.</p>

<p>See the output after running <code>configure</code> and ensure all the options related are OK.</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install freeglut-devel

./configure

make

sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h3>GVars3</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/gvars3.html">GVars3</a> is a configuration library which integrates well with TooN. Not much to worry when buiding.</p>

<pre><code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h2>Build PTAM</h2>

<h3>Run ldconfig</h3>

<p>The libs built above may reside in <code>/usr/local/lib</code> when using the default directorys in their Makefiles, to make the system aware of the newly installed libs.</p>

<pre><code>sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf
add /usr/local/lib to the file
sudo ldconfig
</code></pre>

<h3>Prepare for Makefile</h3>

<pre><code>cd the_PTAM_Directory
cp Build/Linux/* .
vi Makefile
add -lGLU -lGL -llapack to the linker commands
</code></pre>

<h3>Fix usleep declaration</h3>

<pre><code>vi Tracker.cc
add #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; to the first line
</code></pre>

<h3>Build</h3>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>If nothing wrong, you are done!</p>

<h2>Run PTAM</h2>

<p>Simply invoke <code>CameraCalibrator</code> to calibrate your camera. Then invoke <code>PTAM</code> for real fun.</p>

<p>If you use UVC webcam using <code>v4l2</code>, you may want to install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install v4l-utils
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>v4l2-ctl</code> to play with your camera.</p>

<h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>

<p>As the orinigal <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/README.txt">README.txt</a> says, PTAM works well with Nvidia display card, I got <code>Segmentation Fault as soon as ... got video source</code> as I&rsquo;m using a display card shipped with an Intel motherboard.</p>

<p>However, I think the root cause is that the display card driver does not know how to handle the color space coming from the webcam, so I&rsquo;m planning to deep into the mechanism and try to find out why. <a href="http://ewokrampage.wordpress.com/troubleshooting-faq/">George Klein</a> says that a nvidia display card and driver combo works fine after all.</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/06/linux-getting-started-methodologies-and-practices/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-06T22:22:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/06/linux-getting-started-methodologies-and-practices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is basically a topic that I gave to <a href="http://blog-ossclub.rhcloud.com/">Open-CAS</a> group members as a technique share. Since I have known Linux for over 4 years and heavily used it for 2 years more or less, I find myself realy attracted by it.</p>

<p>Also I want others to have the chance to live with a better OS(Unix and Linux, also Mac OS of course), so it&rsquo;s a good time to take the good points out of my mind and let more people know.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to learn from each other especially when there are problems to solve. So I put my mind at a <code>github</code> repo called <a href="https://github.com/hustcalm/linux-getting-started">linux-getting-started</a> and hope that others would join me to make this repo more useful.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What&rsquo;s in this repo</h3>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m addressing two aspects for <code>Linux Getting Started</code>, namely <code>Methodologies</code> and <code>Practices</code>. I know these are really big words, but they just fit here since I want to tell people <code>how to learn</code> not just <code>what to learn</code>.</p>

<h4>Methodologies</h4>

<p>Know what you are gonna do before you step out. Basically, for Linux beginners, the first step that I recommend is <code>install a Linux distro that you like</code>. Then just <code>use it</code> before you want to know everything about it(seems that no one will never ever). It&rsquo;s an OS after all, you use it for your daily job and solve your problems, not a magic software that just plays magic.</p>

<p>A good book would give you a real quick start, I have divided the books into three levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Beginner]</li>
</ul>


<p>Newbies who just get to know Linux &ndash; Learn how to live with shell</p>

<ul>
<li>[Developer]</li>
</ul>


<p>Experienced programmers especially for C/C++ guys &ndash; get used to Linux Platform</p>

<ul>
<li>[Next]</li>
</ul>


<p>Ones who will dive deeper into the most complicated but fun part &ndash; Kernel and Driver</p>

<p><strong>In one word, use it, learn it, dive into it!</strong></p>

<h4>Practices</h4>

<p>Using and Reading will give a quite well understanding for Linux, but not enough for mastering it. To become <code>real Linux users or developers</code>, remember <code>never leave your eyes off the screen and your fingers off your keyboard</code>, practice will just make perfect things and a great Linuxer, believe me:&ndash;)</p>

<p>I address two technical parts currently in this repo, <code>Shell Scripting</code> and <code>Makefile</code>. Other parts will definitely added as long as I maintain this repo.</p>

<h5>Shell Scripting</h5>

<p>Before beginning with <code>Shell Scripting</code>, I suppose you have already been familiar with varies of commands or utilities in shell.</p>

<p>To be straight, <code>shell</code> itself is a program which will interpret user&rsquo;s commands or instructions, convert them to <code>system calls</code> or other things that OS can understand. So basically speaking, <code>shell</code> is the interface between <code>user</code> and <code>OS Kernel</code>.</p>

<p>As a script language, it has its own variables, functions and flow control statements, also it features many other stuff which will ease much pain for system administration but maybe worse if not used properly. When we are writing shell scripts, we are actually dealing with processes and interprocess communication, each process would do its job and we can use <code>pipe</code>, <code>socket</code>, <code>named-pipes</code> or <code>file</code> to let them talk to each other.</p>

<p>You can definitely play some magic with shell scripting by choosing your favorite shell, like <code>Bash</code>, <code>Ksh</code>, <code>Zsh</code>, etc.</p>

<h5>Makefile</h5>

<p>As you get to know <code>shell</code>, you are ready to know something about <code>makefile</code>. Before that, I will talk about <code>make</code>, <code>autotools</code> first.</p>

<p>When we are trying to build a big project, no one want to invoke every single compiling commands by hand which is annoying but also error prone. Here comes <code>make</code> to figure out this problem. So when you download a package with source code, to build it, simply type:</p>

<pre><code>make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Then you are done!</p>

<p>Is this that easy? Reality will really disappoint us, because the user&rsquo;s OS or environment always will not be consistent with the developer&rsquo;s. So <code>make</code> does not easy the pain for buiding a package or software from scratch, but making it easier to manage a big project.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution? Here comes the <code>Autotools</code>, which will generate <code>makefiles</code> automatically according to the configuration of your system. Like you got a third party library A, and one package needs the library for one feature, <code>Autotools</code> will take care of whether you got the library installed, if yes, then build the package with the feature enabled, or just disable it otherwise.</p>

<p>Cool, isn&rsquo;t it? Yes for the users, but maybe no for the developers, I mean all the pain will be transfered to the developers since they got to write <code>Autotools</code> scripts to make things right. Just another wrapper to give a good, cross-platform and generic solution? Some people would quite agree with this opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <code>Autotools</code>, people are getting used to:</p>

<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>There are many others excellent build systems or tools out there, like <code>CMake</code>, <code>QMake</code>, <code>Scons</code>, <code>Ninja</code> ,etc. Go and try them out!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Where is the slide</h3>

<p>Honestly speaking, the slide is just a chain which helps me to make a clear topic. So you will not find it big, just about 15 pages, however to spread all the sparking mind, you will find it&rsquo;s really a <code>big one</code> again.</p>

<p>If you want, download the slide at <a href="https://github.com/hustcalm/linux-getting-started/blob/master/linux-getting-started-%40hustcalm.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>What if I want to see something else</h3>

<p>Cool, buddy, I do hope that we can maintain this repo together and help more people to get started with Linux. So you are welcome to add interesting topics or useful links or good references or books to this repo.</p>

<p>You may either <code>fork</code> this <a href="https://github.com/hustcalm/linux-getting-started">repo</a>, add something interesting, then <code>pull request</code> to me.</p>

<p>Or you can just add what you want to know to the <code>wishList</code> file after <code>fork</code>, maybe shortly I will add stuff about the topic that you care about.</p>

<p>Help others, help yourself:&ndash;)</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/11/04/install-centos-6-dot-4-minial-with-grub2-and-a-usb-stick-the-simple-way/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-04T17:08:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/11/04/install-centos-6-dot-4-minial-with-grub2-and-a-usb-stick-the-simple-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What a shame that I failed over and over to just install CentOS 6.4 minimal to my Desktop PC!!!</p>

<p>I got a broken Ubuntu 12.04 on my hand with a working Grub2, cheers:&ndash;) Also, I luckily have a 4 GB USB stick(who esle dosen&rsquo;t,kidding).</p>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>Install CentOS 6.4 minial with Grub2 and a single USB stick, making no bootable USB stick, but do some tricks with the ISO file instead.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, we need a working Grub(or other bootloaders, I use Grub2), a USB Stick with a vfat or ext2 partition and CentOS ISO file.</p>

<h3>Bootloader</h3>

<p>As I have a broken Ubuntu 12.04 and a already working Grub2, I would just go on.</p>

<p>However, you have many choices due to your OS. Such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grub Legacy</li>
<li>Grub4dos</li>
<li>EasyBCD</li>
</ul>


<h3>ISO</h3>

<p>Download it from a mirror that&rsquo;s close enough to you. Check out the <a href="http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/6/isos/x86_64/">Mirror List</a> and I choose <a href="http://mirrors.163.com/centos/6.4/isos/x86_64/">mirrors.163.com</a>.</p>

<p>Save the <code>CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso</code> to your hard drive.</p>

<h3>USB Stick</h3>

<p>According to the CentOS wiki, the installer will recognize ext2 or vfat. I choose vfat in my case.</p>

<p>My device on my Linuxmint shows /dev/sdb and the partition shows /dev/sdb1. Just ensure that you have a VFAT partition, other things don&rsquo;t matter too much really.</p>

<p>To play with device and partitions, you can use <code>fdisk</code> and <code>mkfs.*</code> or other tools that you favor.</p>

<h3>Extract Files</h3>

<p>I put the ISO file under <code>~/Downloads</code>. And I follow the instructions below:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/centos
sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 ~/Downloads/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso /mnt/centos
mkdir /mnt/usbdisk
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usbdisk
cp -r /mnt/centos/isolinux /mnt/centos/images /mnt/usbdisk
sudo umount /mnt/centos
cp ~/Downloads/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso /mnt/usbdisk
sudo umount /mnt/usbdisk
</code></pre>

<p>After this, we have <code>CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso</code>,<code>isolinux</code> and <code>images</code> on our USB Stick.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Now use Grub2 to boot into CentOS installation environment and complete the installation. I have a SATA hard disk locally and do remember <strong>CentOS installer will make your local hard disk to sdb or sdc, but not sda. The USB Stick will be sda during the installation.</strong></p>

<p>To enter Grub2 command line, press <code>SHIFT</code> when your PC boots, or you may miss the menu entry due to <strong>HIDDEN_TIMEOUT</strong> configruration. Then press <code>c</code> to get a command line.</p>

<p>Then follow the instructions below, you may adjust a little to suit your own PC.</p>

<pre><code>linux (hd1,msdos1)/isolinux/vmlinuz
initrd (hd1,msdos1)/isolinux/initrd.img
boot
</code></pre>

<p>When you prompt to select <code>Installation Method</code>, use <code>Hard Drive</code> and select <code>sda1</code>, follow the routine procedures and you are done:&ndash;)</p>

<p><strong>I tried <code>URL Method</code> but failed, either <code>mirrors.163.com</code> nor <code>mirrors.sohu.com</code> would work:&ndash;(</strong></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All the essentials reside in Grub2 and isolinux or you may say bootloader and ISO stuff. Check them out and deep it for deep is the best way to solve varies of problems related to boot, installation and rescue.</p>

<p>You may install by other methods, CD-ROW, bootable USB Stick or whatever you like.</p>

<p>Enjoy the struggling and enjoy the gain!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, we are under an age called Cloud Computing.</p>

<p>I used to be curious about VPS(Virtual Private Server), how they work, how to build them, etc. As far as I know, AWS, GCE or whatever else solutions depend heavily on Virtualization Technologies and AWS is definitly playing with Xen currently.</p>

<p>I would like very much to have a trial for building my own VPS and blow are my steps doing it. You may need to read some basic wikis about Xen, <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Overview">Xen Overview</a> and <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Beginners_Guide">Xen Beginners Guide</a> should do some help:&ndash;)</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Getting a working Dom0 on Centos6.4</h2>

<h3>Install Centos</h3>

<p>Use whatever way you like, remember a <strong>minimal install</strong> is recommended.</p>

<h3>Install Xen</h3>

<p>Thanks to <strong>Xen4Centos</strong> Project, we can get Xen installed in several simple commands(log in as root).</p>

<pre><code>yum -y update
yum install centos-release-xen
yum install xen
/usr/bin/grub-bootxen.sh
reboot
</code></pre>

<p>After your machine comes to alive, simply type:</p>

<pre><code>uname -r
xl list
</code></pre>

<p>to verify that Xen Dom0 is running.</p>

<h3>Config network</h3>

<p>I use DHCP to get a valid IP for my box and there is a trick if you can&rsquo;t ping each other when two machinea are in the same LAN(probably the routing table is not working for you and just delete the record from your routing table).</p>

<p>As me, for example, my laptop got a IP, say 192.168.0.10 and my VPS got 192.168.0.11, but they can&rsquo;t talk to each:&ndash;(</p>

<p>First, check your routing table,</p>

<pre><code>route
</code></pre>

<p>Then, delete the record that is evil,</p>

<pre><code>route del -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Please substitute the parameters to suite your own networking</strong>.</p>

<p>After that, ping each other,</p>

<pre><code>ping 192.168.0.11
</code></pre>

<p>to verify the networking is good to go.</p>

<p>In order to give our DomUs valid IPs, we may use a network bridge, do as follows:</p>

<pre><code>yum -y install bridge-utils
cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>My modified and working scripts look like this, for ifcfg-xenbr0:</p>

<pre><code>DEVICE=xenbr0
#HWADDR=00:24:E8:46:CC:C9
TYPE=bridge
#UUID=ff0ab497-0303-4dc3-b6f3-4a6cbd90466b
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
</code></pre>

<p>And for ifcfg-eth0:</p>

<pre><code>DEVICE=eth0
HWADDR=00:24:E8:46:CC:C9
TYPE=Ethernet
UUID=ff0ab497-0303-4dc3-b6f3-4a6cbd90466b
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
#BOOTPROTO=dhcp
BRIDGE=xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>For static IP configuration, please refer to Xen wiki page!</strong></p>

<p>Then, make the configuration work:</p>

<pre><code>service network restart
</code></pre>

<p>If you got errors such as <code>error:check cable</code>, do this manualy:</p>

<pre><code>ifup xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>Verify it works by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>ifconfig xenbr0
</code></pre>

<h3>Diable SELinux</h3>

<p>Honestly speaking, I don&rsquo;t know WTF the real reason to do this, but people say <code>SELinux can really interfere with Xen</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
setenforce 0
</code></pre>

<p>You are good to go with a damn working Dom0 and congratulations!</p>

<h2>Bringing Your DomUs Up</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you to use PV or HVM, personally, I prefer to PV due to higher performance. But if you want a Windows(and other OS whose kernel can&rsquo;t be modified), HVM is your only choice.</p>

<p>As for me, I want 3 DomUs, namely Debian, Fedora and Arch Linux.</p>

<h3>Xen4Cli or Xen4Libvirt</h3>

<p>Xen4Cli(xm and xl, currently xm deprecated) are intended for advanced users looking to hand setup the network, the backing filestore and the xen environment. While Xen4Libvirt are for newbies looking for the easiest install path.</p>

<p>I prefer <code>xl</code> since I want to know what exactly is happening, and <code>xl</code> works for Debian and Arch Linux. However for Fedora, <code>Libvert</code> seems to be the right way(using <code>virt-install</code>).</p>

<p>To install Libvirt,</p>

<pre><code>yum install libvirt python-virtinst libvirt-daemon-xen
</code></pre>

<p>After the install, restart your Dom0 machine.</p>

<h3>File or LVM based backend</h3>

<p>Since Centos6.4 is shipped perfectly with LVM and also the default partition schema using LVM during OS Installation, I prefer <code>LVM</code>.</p>

<p>As for me, I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>lvresize -L -200G vg_centos6/lv_home -r
lvcreate -L 30G -n fedora vg_centos6
lvcreate -L 30G -n debian vg_centos6
lvcreate -L 30G -n archlinux vg_centos6
</code></pre>

<p>Then verify the Logical Volumes using:</p>

<pre><code>lvdisplay
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>lvs
</code></pre>

<p>If you are not familiar with LVM, search Google for a good tutorial first.</p>

<h3>Bridge, Routing or NAT</h3>

<p>Three networking modes are provided and choose one according to your own networking environment.</p>

<p>I got bridge working for me as described in above section.</p>

<p>For choosing other modes, you can modify <code>/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</code> or explicitly passing as parameters when creating DomUs.</p>

<h3>Let DomUs fly</h3>

<h4>Debian</h4>

<p>I choose debian7.1 netinst.iso due to my poor bandwidth,</p>

<pre><code>wget -c http://mirrors.sohu.com/debian-cd/7.1.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-7.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso
mount -o loop /path/to/debian-7.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso /mnt/debian
cp /mnt/debian/install.amd/xen/debian.cfg /etc/xen/
cd /etc/xen/
vi debian.cfg  ## Make modifications according to the comments
xl create -c debian.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Then install Debian as a very normal one.</p>

<h4>Arch Linux</h4>

<p>I download archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://mirrors.sohu.com/archlinux/iso/latest/archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a arch.cfg file in <code>/etc/xen/</code> similar like:</p>

<pre><code># Refer to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xen#Configuring_a_paravirtualized_.28PV.29_Arch_domU

name = "arch"
kernel = "/mnt/arch/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz"
ramdisk = "/mnt/arch/arch/boot/x86_64/archiso.img"
extra = "archisobasedir=arch archisolabel=ARCH_201310"
memory = 512
disk = [ "phy:/dev/vg_centos6/archlinux,sda1,w", "file:/root/isos/arch/archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso,sdb,r" ]
vif = [ '' ]
</code></pre>

<p>After that, bring the DomU up by:</p>

<pre><code>mount /path/to/archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso /mnt/arch
cd /etc/xen/
xl create -c arch.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Install your Arch Linux as you like since it&rsquo;s really a highly customized distro.</p>

<h4>Fedora</h4>

<p>Again I got Fedora-20-Alpha-x86_64-netinst.iso by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/test/20-Alpha/Fedora/x86_64/iso/Fedora-20-Alpha-x86_64-netinst.iso
</code></pre>

<p>However, nightmares begin since I want to install it using the Debian way. <code>xl</code> just fails to boot normally but <code>virt-install</code> does the job.</p>

<p>Using the <code>virt-install</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>virt-install --virt-type xen -n fedora19 -r 512 --vcpus=2 -f /dev/vg_centos6/fedora19 --location http://mirrors.163.com/fedora/releases/19/Fedora/x86_64/os/ --os-type linux --accelerate --nographics --network=bridge:xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can download the ISO file first, then issuing your own httpd locally, thus making it:</p>

<pre><code>mount -o loop /path/to/fedora.iso /mnt/fedora
yum -y install httpd
service httpd start
ln -s /mnt/fedora /var/www/html
service iptables stop
virt-install --virt-type xen -n fedora19 -r 512 --vcpus=2 -f /dev/vg_centos6/fedora19 --location http://your.http.server.ip.address.here/ --os-type linux --accelerate --nographics --network=bridge:xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>Remember this is for full Fedora installation, if you are using a netinst, you need to copy all the files to /var/www/html instead of creating a symbolic link and modify the .treeinfo file. No warrants here, since I did&rsquo;t try it myself.</p>
