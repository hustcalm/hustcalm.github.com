    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After being the reviewer for the <a href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/02/10/review-of-beaglebone-robotic-projects-from-a-technical-perspective/">BeagleBone Robotic Projects</a>, I&rsquo;m honored to be the reviewer for another book about robotic projects named <a href="http://bit.ly/1hrlCQP">Raspberry Pi Robotic Projects</a>. I will go no further to talk about the differences about <code>BeagleBone</code> and <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, all I know is that they are both cool and amazing. To start to play with <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, I suggest that you
can list the book <a href="http://bit.ly/1hrlCQP">Raspberry Pi Robotics Projects</a> as an option.</p>

<p>In this post, I will give you a very quick overview of the book and tell why it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Getting Started with Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>Have no idea what is really <code>Raspberry Pi</code>? Well, just treat it as your <code>Mini Computer</code>. The truth is, it got almost everything what a PC should be equipped with. What&rsquo;s more, it runs Linux which means you can do tons of things with it!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, <code>Raspberry Pi</code> is leading the <code>open hardware community</code> somehow, people design, manufacture, develop and play. Geeks use it for their geek life!</p>

<p>In <strong>chapter 1</strong>, you will be informed the hardware and software of <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and begin to be friends with her.</p>

<h4>Programming Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>As you want to make <code>Raspberry Pi</code> do something really amazing, you should know how to talk to her. Well, you program to talk. So in <strong>chapter 2</strong>, we will show you how to get comfortable with the way <code>talking(programming)</code>. Besides to knowing <code>Linux</code>, use <code>Python</code> and <code>C/C++</code> is cool:&ndash;)</p>

<h4>Providing Speech Input and Output</h4>

<p>What? You want to talk to her, really. I mean by <code>speaking</code>. Well, that should not be problem. Let&rsquo;s give our robot <code>ears</code> and <code>mouth</code>. <strong>Chapter 3</strong> will show you how to use <code>PocketSphinx</code> to accept your voice commands and utilize <code>Espeak</code> to make <code>Raspberry Pi</code> talk in a robot voice.</p>

<h4>Adding Vision to Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>How can a beautiful girl be blind! So to make <code>Rasberry Pi</code> see the amazing world, <strong>chapter 4</strong> will tell you how to connect the USB cemara to <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and begin to use <code>OpenCV</code>, which is a fully featured vision library to detect colored objects.</p>

<h4>Creating Mobile Robots on Wheels</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s roll! To see the beatiful world around, we need to make our robot able to move. <strong>Chapter 5</strong> will show you how to add motor controller to <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and let her run at free will.</p>

<h4>Making the Unit Very Mobile &ndash; Controlling the Movement of a Robot with Legs</h4>

<p>A girl should really walk, doesn&rsquo;t it? No problem, <strong>chapter 6</strong> tells how to get started with <code>servos</code> and make your mobile platform truly mobile just as a person.</p>

<h4>Avoiding Obstacles Using Sensors</h4>

<p>Oh, there is a wall in front, danger! Don&rsquo;t worry, our <code>Raspberry Pi</code> knows everything and will avoid it easily. <strong>Chapter 7</strong> shows how to use an <code>infrared sensor</code> and <code>USB sonar sensor</code> with <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, also how to use a <code>servo</code> to move a single sensor to make our sening range large enough.</p>

<h4>Going Truly Mobile &ndash; The Remote Control of Your Robot</h4>

<p>You will not always be around with your <code>Raspberry Pi</code>, right? To make sure your <code>Pi</code> is always with you, <strong>Chapter 8</strong> demonstrates how to connect wireless devices to <code>Pi</code> thus enabling us to talk to her remotely. Use a <code>wireless USB keyboard</code>, or <code>a wireless LAN</code> or <code>a ZigBee device</code>, choose as you like.</p>

<h4>Using a GPS Receiver to Locate Your Robot</h4>

<p>No one wants to be told that his <code>Raspberry Pi</code> is lost. Fortunately, we got <code>GPS</code> nowadays for almost free. Connecting <code>Raspberry Pi</code> to a <code>GPS</code> device and accessing the <code>GPS</code> programmatically is mainly covered in <strong>chapter 9</strong>.</p>

<h4>System Dynamics</h4>

<p>Get tired with so much coding for each dedicated task? <strong>Chaper 10</strong> will free you from hell by creating a general control structure. Also you can enable complex functionalities by using the structure of the <code>Robot Operating System</code>.</p>

<h4>By Land, Sea, and Air</h4>

<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t just want a <code>Raspbery Pi</code>, you really want is a <code>Quadrotor</code>, or a <code>submarine</code> or a <code>mini ship</code>! Nothing is impossible, <strong>Chapter 11</strong> will be a good starting point to creat something really amazing.</p>

<p>I hope that you like <code>Raspberry Pi</code> and the book will do some good. Happy playing and hakcing with <code>Raspberry Pi</code>!!!</p>

    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/04/17/what-is-socket-anyway</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bet you&rsquo;ve heard of <code>socket</code> for a while, but do you really know what is a <code>socket</code>?</p>

<p>This post is a quick getting-started for figuring out the basic concepts of socket and hopefully enpowers you to begin writing simple network programming snippets. It aims to bootstrap your understanding to socket and network programming and serves as a good starting point to truth. From definition to practice and deep into research, let&rsquo;s start the venture!</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The definition</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley sockets</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Let history and standards tell everything.</p>

<h2>Unix or Internet</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-performance/2005-February/001143.html">unix domain sockets vs. internet sockets</a></li>
</ul>


<p>See what the freebsd gurus say.</p>

<h2>Unix socket deeper</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thomasstover.com/uds.html">Demystifying Unix Domain Sockets</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Code tells the truth.</p>

<h2>Network Programming Go</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html">Beej&rsquo;s Guide to Network Programming Using Internet Sockets</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Practices make best.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/176409/how-to-build-a-simple-http-server-in-c">How to Build a simple HTTP server in C</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Wonder how to implement a HTTP server, like <code>Apache</code> or <code>Nginx</code>, you&rsquo;d better implement a simple, stupid but your own one.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">The C10K problem</a></li>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/04/17/build-ptam-on-fedora-20-the-easy-way-10-minutes-tutorial/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-17T19:21:41+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/04/17/build-ptam-on-fedora-20-the-easy-way-10-minutes-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since the last post <a href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/09/27/ptam-compilation-on-linux-howto/">PTAM Compilation on Linux-HowTo</a> about playing with PTAM. And now Isis Innovation has released the source code under GPLv3 and put it on <a href="https://github.com/Oxford-PTAM/PTAM-GPL">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Last time, we demostrate detailed instructions on how to get PTAM running on Debian derived systems(Linux Mint 15 and Ubuntu 12.04), now I want talk about building the source code on Fedora 20. It won&rsquo;t be long, since I just want to talk about the key components, thus the mandatory dependencies(<strong>TooN, libCVD, Gvars3, OpenGL, libjpeg, libpng, libtiff</strong>, etc).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As the PTAM source code use the GNU autoconf tools, so the typical way to install is <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code>, however, to make sure that certain third libs are correctly configured and can found when running <code>configure</code>, you may want to have a look at the output after <code>configure</code> and install any key dependency which is missed.</p>

<p>Whenever you are not sure, see the <strong>Official Website</strong> for sure!!!</p>

<h2>Install Dependencies</h2>

<h3>TooN</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/toon.html">TooN</a> is a numerics library used by libCVD. Since they are just a bundle of header files, installation is trivial.</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install liblapack-devel
sudo yum install libblas-devel

./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h3>libCVD</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/">libCVD</a> is a very portable and high performance C++ library for computer vision, image, and video processing.</p>

<p>This is the key component for building PTAM, thus should be careful. Make sure you installed OpenGL correctly, also for the video source, if you are using a UVC webcam, check if <code>v4l2</code> is working. Or if you are using a IEEE1394 camera, get libxx1394 series libs installed which can drive your camera. For Image I/O, always have libjpeg, libpng and libtiff.</p>

<p>See the output after running <code>configure</code> and ensure all the options related are OK.</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install freeglut-devel

./configure

make

sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h3>GVars3</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/gvars3.html">GVars3</a> is a configuration library which integrates well with TooN. Not much to worry when buiding.</p>

<pre><code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h2>Build PTAM</h2>

<h3>Run ldconfig</h3>

<p>The libs built above may reside in <code>/usr/local/lib</code> when using the default directorys in their Makefiles, to make the system aware of the newly installed libs.</p>

<pre><code>sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf
add /usr/local/lib to the file
sudo ldconfig
</code></pre>

<h3>Prepare for Makefile</h3>

<pre><code>cd the_PTAM_Directory
cp Build/Linux/* .
vi Makefile
add -lGLU -lGL -llapack to the linker commands
</code></pre>

<h3>Fix usleep declaration</h3>

<pre><code>vi Tracker.cc
add #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; to the first line
</code></pre>

<h3>Build</h3>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>If nothing wrong, you are done!</p>

<h2>Run PTAM</h2>

<p>Simply invoke <code>CameraCalibrator</code> to calibrate your camera. Then invoke <code>PTAM</code> for real fun.</p>

<p>If you use UVC webcam using <code>v4l2</code>, you may want to install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install v4l-utils
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>v4l2-ctl</code> to play with your camera.</p>

<h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>

<p>As the orinigal <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/README.txt">README.txt</a> says, PTAM works well with Nvidia display card, I got <code>Segmentation Fault as soon as ... got video source</code> as I&rsquo;m using a display card shipped with an Intel motherboard.</p>

<p>However, I think the root cause is that the display card driver does not know how to handle the color space coming from the webcam, so I&rsquo;m planning to deep into the mechanism and try to find out why. <a href="http://ewokrampage.wordpress.com/troubleshooting-faq/">George Klein</a> says that a nvidia display card and driver combo works fine after all.</p>

    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/04/09/look-inside-mongoose-an-easy-to-use-web-server-implementation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I come across with Network Programming recently and find it really charming. Afer reading the book &ldquo;Advanced Linux Programming&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m more curious about how to implement a basic http server or web server.</p>

<p>The source code of chapter 11 of &ldquo;ALP&rdquo; does tell the key idea, thus communicating through sockets between client and server, for HTTP compliance, just implement the HTTP protocal(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC
2616</a>). To know the things better, I&rsquo;d like to know how to implement a core and basic HTTP server. You may know &lsquo;Apache&rsquo;, &lsquo;NginX&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lighttpd&rsquo; for a while, and they do lead the main tread. Basically, they are heavy enough to begin to know a basic HTTP server implementation.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After googling around, I find <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/176409/how-to-build-a-simple-http-server-in-c">this link on stackoverflow</a> is valuable and a good starting point to follow. From there, I decide to dig into <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/">mongoose</a>. To walk through what mongoose does and provides, I will present some comments of core source code.</p>

<h2>Be aware of the Protocal Stack</h2>

<p>Many people get confused by <code>HTTP</code>, <code>FTP</code>, <code>TCP/IP</code>, <code>SMTP</code>, etc. To get all these stuff clear of your head, do please spend several miniutes to learn the <code>Internet communication model</code>, like the <code>OSI 7-layer model</code> or the <code>TCP/IP 4-layer model</code>.</p>

<p>Once you know the <code>phsical</code>, <code>data-link</code>, <code>network</code>, <code>transportation</code>, <code>application</code> what&rsquo;s all about, trust me, you will find all the confused words gone:&ndash;)</p>

<h2>HTTP Basics</h2>

<p>A web server, basicly implements the <code>HTTP</code> protocol to define how <code>the client interacts with the server</code>, thus enabling the communication of varies of devices. But aware that <code>HTTP</code> is an application protocol, built upon <code>TCP/IP</code> which handles the real transportation of data, in the perspective of programming, that is <code>Socket</code>.</p>

<p>Give the references a shot:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/HTTP_Basics.html">HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol) Basics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177">HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/">HTTP Made Really Easy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sanjoysanyal/http-basics">HTTP basics &ndash; slideshare</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Socket Basics</h2>

<p>In a word, <code>socket</code> is the <code>API</code> of <code>TCP/IP</code> provided to programmers.
See my blog <a href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/04/17/what-is-socket-anyway/">What Is Socket Anyway?</a>.</p>

<h2>Cross Platform development concerns</h2>

<p>Wow, <code>Mongoose</code> works on Windows, Mac, UNIX/Linux, iPhone, Android eCos, QNX and many other platforms, what an amazing software!</p>

<p>Well, the basic idea behind <code>cross platform development</code> is to abstract another layer to adapt to the different implementations to the same task on different <code>OS and platforms</code>, my personal understanding, sorry:&ndash;)</p>

<p>When you see the source code of <code>Mongoose</code>, be prepared to come across with lots of <code>#ifdef</code> and <code>#ifndef</code>, etc. Things got really complicated when dealing with <code>cross platform development</code>, there are even specifed books and literatures talking about it.</p>

<p>OK I&rsquo;m also newbie to this, so please <code>RTFSC</code>.</p>

<h2>HTTP features kept in mind</h2>

<p>As an <code>embedded</code> web server, <code>Mongoose</code> needs not to implement everything, just the core functionalities, however really powerful enough. Like <code>CGI, SSI, SSL, Digest auth, Websocket, WEbDAV, Resumed download, URL rewrite, file blacklist, Custom error pages, Virtual hosts, IP-based ACL, Windows service</code>, even <code>Lua Server Pages</code>.</p>

<p>As <code>HTTP</code> is an application protocol, so every feature is really related to the description in the <code>RFC</code>s along with many more extensions like <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2818/">HTTPS &ndash; HTTP over TLS</a>.</p>

<p>Though many heavy web servers like <code>Apache</code> or <code>Nginx</code> does not implement everything of <code>HTTP</code>, so <code>keep it simple and work</code>.</p>

<h2>The programming paradigm</h2>

<p>There is not any <code>class</code> defined in <code>Mongoose</code>, though it can be compiled using <code>C++</code>, so the source code is <code>pure C</code> actually. The underlying dirty work will be handled by <a href="https://github.com/cesanta/net_skeleton">net_skeleton</a>, like the <code>management of socket connections</code> and <code>sending and receiving data packets</code>.</p>

<p>To be clear, <code>object</code> is implemented through the use of <code>struct</code>, like <code>mg_server</code>, <code>mg_connection</code>. Get a good knowledge of <code>C programming language</code> before you decide to dig into <code>Mongoose</code>, period.</p>

<h2>I/O Models to know</h2>

<p><code>Blocking I/O</code> or <code>Asynchronous I/O</code>?</p>

<p>See the following references for good:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.madwizard.org/programming/tutorials/netcpp/5">NetworkingCPP &ndash; I/O Models</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">The C10K problem</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-async/">Boost application performance using asynchronous I/O</a></li>
</ul>


<p><code>Mongoose</code> is using the traditional <code>select()</code>, serving many clients with each thread, and using nonblocking I/O as illustrated in the function <code>ns_server_poll</code> implemented in <code>net_skeleton</code>.</p>

<h2>The core of Mongoose</h2>

<p>Let the journey begin!</p>

<h3>Net Skeleton</h3>

<p>Quote from <a href="https://github.com/cesanta/net_skeleton">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Net Skeleton is a networking library written in C. It provides easy to use event-driven interface that allows to implement network protocols or scalable network applications with little effort. Net Skeleton releives developers from the burden of network programming complexity and let them concentrate on the logic. Net Skeleton saves time and money.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近读书比较多，想着尽快把自己的短板补一补，读的过程中有点自己的感悟，发现IT书籍也是口味各异，都能跟文学书籍类比一下了，在此扯淡几句，图个乐子。</p>

<p>要是说文学书籍，大家可能会想到“散文”，“议论文”，“记叙文”，“诗歌”，“回忆录”之类的。而说到IT书籍，诸如编程语言，操作系统，嵌入式，Web开发框架，设计模式，面向对象等等之类的书可能会立马涌上心头。当下电子书给传统的纸质书造成了很大的冲击，在这种情况下，更要合理地调整自己的阅读习惯。在琳琅满目的书籍面前，每个人都面临选择，该购买哪本书，如何在有限的时间内吸收书中的精华，达到自己的阅读目的？下面就我自己的阅读经历分析一下以上问题。</p>

<!--more-->


<hr />

<h3>充分调研再选书，优先经典，适合自己</h3>

<p>现在的出版行业已经发达到“是个人都能出书”的地步了。所以在对某一类的书或者某本特别的书产生阅读欲望的时候，一定先要仔细评估一下，经过评估后才会买到对自己来说有价值的书，避免“被作者误导”。在学习方面，如果你不确定，我还是建议向“权威”学习，尤其是在计算机行业，同样是讲C++的书，我会毫不犹豫地优先选择“C++之父”的著作，他发明了C++，相比而言当然更有资格讲解并传授给他人。</p>

<p>既然说是IT书籍了，那就从技术书籍入手。举个例子，你想入门C语言了，怎么办？本科的时候，大家都知道“谭浩强”了，但是那本书很大程度上是被选择的，而不是我们自愿的。现在大家都有了独立思考的能力，自然会去Google搜索一下“C语言入门书籍”，看一些高质量的帖子，再问问身边一些C语言水平还可以的同学或者同事，基本上就可以甄别出什么才是“真正的C语言入门书籍”或者“C语言学习书籍”。基本上大家应该都比较推崇C语言三驾马车，即《C和指针》，《C陷阱和缺陷》，《C专家编程》。而这三本书又风格各异，虽然都是讲C语言的，但是就入门来说，《C和指针》当属首选，它讲解比较系统，循序渐进，初学者容易接受；而《C专家编程》正如书名所说，比较适合进阶学习；而对于《C陷阱和缺陷》，我个人感觉比较适合查漏补缺。</p>

<p>以上提到的三本书应该都是“C语言学习”领域还算经典的书，而最经典的莫过于“C语言之父”的《The C
Programming》，为啥不推荐这个小手册呢？虽说要靠近经典，但是也要因地制宜，“C语言”本身的核心是其编译器，而“C语言之父”的经典书籍是对语言本身的规范说明，类似产品说明书，我想给编译器开发者看比较合适，而对于试图学习如何使用这门语言的新手显然不是特别合适（当然也有例外，计算机背景特别强，编程天赋良好的人也许看看这本书就足够了）。</p>

<p>计算机本身是美国的专利，因此很多书籍开始都是“英文书籍”，社会发展到如今，主流的计算机书籍已经都有了“中译本”，那么读原版还是译本？这要看个人，英文功底允许的话，强烈推荐看原版，很多专业词汇在原著中表达地更加自然，有助于对技术本身的理解；英文跟不太上的话，看中译本也无妨，但是要提前做好思维上的准备，不要被译者的一些主观理解误导了（这种情况肯定存在，但好在不是很多）。</p>

<p>好了，我们定下了选择书籍的基调，如果有的选，就要“经典”的，甚至说“正统”的，耐心阅读，基本上可以把某一个领域的技术涵盖完全；一定要避免读了好几本烂书，没学到知识反而被误导了不少，就本科的C语言学习来说，这种情况是存在着的。尽量读英文原版，尽管不想承认，IT技术是被美国支配的，习惯阅读英文资料可以在一定程度上减少信息传播的延迟。</p>

<p>有了这个基调之后，我们还要选择“适合自己”的书籍，这在《Essential C++》的作者序言中也得到了有力的支撑，作者试图找一本能够“快速入门”Perl的小书，并强调存在这么一本小书是多么地必要。总的来讲，我觉得“适合自己”的书需要符合你的“阅读目的”。如果是想深入研究，那么买一本透彻讲解的书再好不过，比如《C++
Primer》；而为了快速上手，解决实际问题，那么一本小小的“handbook”可能就是你要找的；假如不太想偏技术，喜欢看看哲学讨论，那么看看“ESR”的书还是不错的。</p>

<p>选择正是你的品味的体现，相信随着阅读量的增大，你的阅读品味也会随之提高，并且更加适合自己。</p>

<p>时间是宝贵的，不要把它浪费在“一本烂书”上。</p>

<hr />

<h3>正确的阅读方法会事半功倍</h3>

<p>我们已经选好了书，是不是已经迫不及待地想开始阅读旅程？很多时候，我们不是缺书，我们是没有找到“正确且适合自己的”阅读方法。</p>

<p>有些人喜欢一口气图个痛快，有些人喜欢按部就班一天读一小段，而有些人直捣黄龙，找自己最关心的那一部分细细品味。是不是有点读文学书籍的意思了？就像文章开头说的，IT书籍也是风格各异，不同的书适合不同的读法，同时阅读方法需要紧密地和你的“阅读目的”联系起来。通读也好，略读也罢，只求书中之精华能为我所用，达到融会贯通之境界。</p>

<p>IT书籍大体可分为“工具入门类”，“理论原理类”，“实战经验总结类”，“技术文集类”，“面试备战类”等等。先说一些“散文”类的，比如Paul
Graham的《黑客与画家》，此类书是其多年的文章荟萃而成，因此非常适合跳读，找到自己感兴趣的略读；对于“工具入门”，比如语言入门，软件使用入门，最好按部就班，一步一个脚印地踏实学习，才能修成正果；而对于“实战”类，实际操作才是王道；“理论原理”则需要仔细琢磨，慢慢推敲，理解其原理后需要能够举一反三，解决实际问题；而“面试”类书籍，在我看来尽可以当成快餐书籍，短时间内研读。</p>

<p>在这里举个例子吧，比如你要学习Linux，想找一些参考书籍，比如《Running Linux》，《Linux In a Nutshell》，《The Linux Command Line》，《Advanced Linux Programming》之类的。那么这四本书的阅读方法一定是不同的，拿《Running
Linux》来说，它全书分为四个部分，包括“Linux使用”，“系统管理”，“Linux编程”和“Linux服务器”。阅读的时候选自己想读的部分即可，即当成“参考书”。而后面两本更甚，《Linux In a Nutshell》就像是一个Linux的“字典”或者“百科全书”，《The Linux Command Line》相对精简，但也重“参考”。相反，《ALP》则专注开发，适合系统地学习。</p>

<p>说到这里，再补充一下“书籍选择”的问题吧，更多的是在“电子书籍”和“纸质书籍”之间的折中。我个人觉得“电子书”一定是未来的大方向，符合现代生活节奏和生活理念。我个人的策略是，对于工具类和参考类的书籍，尽量用电子版，一来参考起来十分方便，在文件中搜索即可，二来不费钱也不占地方（目前来看，很多IT书籍存在不用出纸质版的必要的嫌疑，它们的出版很可能是由于工业惯性）。而对于经典的原理类书籍，需要仔细推敲，则买回来纸质版仔细研读是最合适不过的了。
而对于任何一本书，我比较推荐从大体上先有一个宏观的认识，即浏览一下书籍的目录结构，掌握书籍的脉络和行文风格，看看是否符合自己的学习习惯，如果不符合，大可以自己调整看的顺序，对于《程序员的自我修养》这本书，我个人的阅读顺序为4，1，2，3。前言我也是非常推荐大家看的，从这里面可以比较准确地把握作者在书中试图表达什么以及其成书的目的。每每阅读书的前言，我都会觉得很有意思，比如正在阅读的《松本行弘的程序世界》一书，就能切身感受到作者的幽默。</p>

<p>读书自然是抱着自己的目的的，时刻不要忘记了，你阅读是为了什么，带着问题去阅读，去思考，取其精华。单纯地享受阅读的乐趣，我也是不反对的，有时我就是这样的吧。</p>

<hr />

<h3>善于总结，让知识沉淀</h3>

<p>选了书，读了书，不能就这么算了。你的时间投入需要得到应有的回报，而阅读一本书最好的回报无异于“知识转化，为我所用”。大多数情况下，由人类的记忆特性决定的，阅读过程中的一些体会和醍醐灌顶，冷却一段时间后便又无影无踪。因此，阅读之后是一定要写点什么的，最好是边读边写，一边阅读一边记笔记会一定程度影响阅读速度，但是效率奇高。如果是纸质书，也可以直接在书上记下自己的心得和理解，阅读之后再写个书评，效果更佳。</p>

<p>还有一点就是在有可能的情况下，多跟身边的人交流阅读心得，我觉得“读书会”是一个很好的方式，无奈当下生活节奏过快，线下的“读书会”难以组织，那么线上的一些评论网站就是不二的选择了。我个人目前比较推荐豆瓣读书，我的个人读书页面在<a href="http://book.douban.com/people/hustcalm/">这里</a>。</p>

<p>这两天读了“多看阅读”上一本小书，叫做“独立博客”，由简书出品，虽然有点广告性质，但是里面独立博主的一些感想很有启发性。当下大环境下，独立博客更像是互联网中的孤岛，是博主自娱自乐的地方。希望在我的自娱自乐中能够带给大家一些帮助，如果你能到达我的孤岛的话:&ndash;)</p>

    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/02/10/review-of-beaglebone-robotic-projects-from-a-technical-perspective</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m lucky to be a reviewer for the book <code>Beaglebone Robotic Projects</code> few months ago released by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">PACKT</a>. And I&rsquo;d like to recommend this book to readers who would like to play with <code>Beagle</code> for a while and start their own robotic projects. Below I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about this book from a technical perspective.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>First of all, here is the cover of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/beaglebone-robotic-projects/book">BeagleBone Robotic Projects</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/beaglebone-robotic-projects/book"><img src="http://hustcalm.me/images/blog_images/books/9329OT_BeagleBone_Robotic_Projects_cov.jpg"></a></p>

<h3>What you will learn from this book</h3>

<h4>What is BeagleBone Black</h4>

<p>As a <code>mini PC</code> or something, it is compared to <code>Raspberry Pi</code> sometimes. Some people would play with them as toys, some would like to do some amazing projects. It is a typical representative of <code>open source hardware</code>! And it runs the incredible <code>Linux</code>. Chapter 1 will guide you through to get your BeagleBone to work with a fully functioning desktop.</p>

<h4>Talk with BeagleBone Black through programming</h4>

<p>To be able to get started with BeagleBone and do what you want, some background in <code>Linux</code>, <code>Python</code> and <code>Programming</code> will be required. The 2nd chapter of the book will show you the basic Linux commands, brief tutorial for Python, etc.</p>

<h4>Simple speech recognition and make the robot speak</h4>

<p>Chapter 3 shows us how to make your robot speak as a robot utilizing <code>eSpeak</code> and how to do simple speech recognition using <code>PocketSphnix</code>. Also to test the <code>USB sound device</code>, we use <code>AlsaMixer</code> built upon <code>ALSA</code> libraries.</p>

<h4>Use camera as the Robot&rsquo;s eyes</h4>

<p>In chapter 4, the book first shows how to connect a USB camera to BeagleBone and viewing the images with <code>GUVCViewer</code>. After that is guide for installing a full-featured vision library &ndash; <code>OpenCV</code>. Then is a demo for detecting colored objects using <code>OpenCV</code>.</p>

<h4>Make it run by using Servos and Motors</h4>

<p>Chapter 5 will tell you how to make a <code>wheeled</code> robot and chapter 6 will show how a <code>legged</code> robot is made. The instructions for hooking up the wires and demos for controlling the servos and motors would definitely help a lot.</p>

<h4>Sense the environment to make some intelligence</h4>

<p>For avoiding obstables, we use a <code>USB sonar sensor</code> in chapter 7, or people will call it <code>ultrasonic sensor</code>. And for letting your robot know where it is, the book shows how to use a <code>GPS</code> module in chapter 9.</p>

<h4>Remote control for more fun</h4>

<p>Chapter 8 shows how to hook up a <code>LCD</code> display to your BeagleBone and control your robot with a <code>2.4GHz Keyboard</code>. Just imagine how it would be fun to see your robot running around whereas you just sitting there.</p>

<h4>Impossible is nothing</h4>

<p>Want something more? Chapter 10 will teach you how to integrate all the parts and skills covered in previous chapters to make a whole system. For more fun, chapter 11 is a good starting point. Want a sailing robot, flying robot or a submarine robot? This chapter will help a lot.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Highlights</h3>

<p>For the highlights of the book, I want to say that it covers a lot for a typical <code>embedded system</code> and will be very helpful tutorials for hobbiests to get started with their robotic projects. Not only hardware, but also open source software are widely used, instructions are clear and easy to read. To summarize,</p>

<ul>
<li>You will know basic Linux through this book</li>
<li>Python will be your handy programming language for doing robotic projects</li>
<li>Getting to know various useful software packages(eSpeak, PocketSphinx, OpenCV, GUVCViewer, etc)</li>
<li>Know the actuators for typical robots(servos and motors)</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of sensors(ultrasonic, camera, GPS, etc)</li>
<li>Good starting point to make something big(multicopter maybe)</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>In a word, you may as well give the book a try and hope it can help:&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I happened to get to know <code>Google Webmaster Tools</code>, <code>Google Analytics</code> and <code>Google Authorship Markup</code> when I try to tweak my <code>Octopress</code> website. Found that Google is really doing lots of interesting things for our websites, I will share some useful tips and links here.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Google Webmaster Tools</h3>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Official Webmasters</a> to get started, first try to look around to know what <code>Webmasters</code> aims to do. After that, login to <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools">Webmaster Tools</a> , add your website by clicking <code>Add Website</code>, then verify the website according to the hints.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As long as you have claimed the owership of your website, you can see the dashboard for detailed information. You can submit your <code>sitemap</code>, see the <code>search query</code> statistics, the status of your website.</p>

<p>Explore more to find something more exciting:&ndash;)</p>

<p>To be more professional, see <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en">Webmaster Guidelines</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

<p>Even better, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> will let you know every single click from users to your website. See <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/features/index.html">Analytics features</a> for complete lists to know what <code>Analytics</code> can do. Initially set up for commercial use or marketing promotion, we can adapt this technique to our personal website.</p>

<p>Also, look carefully about <code>your website report</code>, I bet you will find something interesting. For developers, there are <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/?csw=1">Developer Guides &amp; Reference for Google Analytics</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Google Authorship</h3>

<p>Well, it would be cool to attribute the article or post to its author, <a href="https://plus.google.com/authorship">Google Authorship</a> is the one who helps.</p>

<p>See the professional article <a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-definitive-guide-to-google-authorship-markup-123218">The Definitive Guide To Google Authorship Markup</a> for details. To test if you have successfully set your authorship, use <a href="www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">Google Structured Data Testing
Tool</a>.</p>

<p>As for me, I verified my authorship through my Email related to my domain bought from <a href="https://name.com">name.com</a>. Simple Enable <code>Email Service</code> through the domain dashboard, you can set up a forward Email for your owned domain Email address.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Google FeedBurner</h3>

<p><a href="http://feedburner.google.com">FeedBurner</a> is a service for <code>RSS</code> subscribe. It&rsquo;s flexible enough and ease your pain when switching domains.</p>

<p>After you add your blog to feedburner, it supports <code>RSS readers</code> by default. So if you want your readers to subscribe through their Emails, go to your feeds and click <code>Publicize</code>, then click <code>Email Subscriptions</code>, down the page to click <code>Active</code> to make the service alive.</p>

<p>See other tabs of your feeds, there are really lots of for you to tweak and play with.</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/22/simply-get-boinc-running-on-centos-6-dot-4-and-earn-xrp/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-22T08:56:56+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/22/simply-get-boinc-running-on-centos-6-dot-4-and-earn-xrp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I got to know <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu">BOINC</a> from a friend and find it funny to play with. <code>BOINC</code> is an open-source software platform for computing using volunteered resources, which means that people can donate their computing resources to varies of research projects through it. <code>BOINC</code> is an acronym for <code>Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing</code>. See <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu">their website</a> for more details.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>However, <code>BOINC</code> has the client side and the server side, in order to let people know what projects they can contribute to, how about their statistics and rankings, etc, we have <a href="http://worldcommunitygrid.org">World Community Grid</a>, namely the server side. <strong>World Community Grid(WCG)</strong> is an effort to create the world&rsquo;s largest public computing grid to tackle scientific research projects that benefit humanity, Launched on November 16, 2004, it is funded and operated by IBM with client
software currently available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD operating systems. Here for the client software, it is the <code>BOINC</code> we refered above. For <strong>WCG</strong> itself, go to <a href="http://worldcommunitygrid.org">their website</a> and also see <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/business_analytics/article/wcg.html">this article from IBM</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, people just donate their computing resources for free, but we can also donate for good. Here comes the <a href="https://www.computingforgood.org">Computing for Good</a> brought by <a href="http://ripple.com">rippleLabs</a>. They are giving away XRP in exchange for donating computing power to scientific research via World Community Grid. Anyone with an Internet-connected computer or Android device can participate.</p>

<p>So we are going to earn XRP for donating our computing power, for me, on a <code>DELL Optiplex 960</code> running <code>CentOS 6.4 x86_64</code>. Here goes the steps.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Register for World Community Grid</h3>

<p>Go to <a href="http://worldcommunitygrid.org">World Community Grid</a> and click <code>Join Today!</code>, or just click <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do">here</a> for direct portal. Complete the registration form and you are ready to go. For the software, you may download according to your operating system from here, or go to <code>BOINC</code>. I will give installation details in the next section.</p>

<p><strong>After your registration, login and go to settings, then join the team <code>Ripple Labs</code>.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>Get BOINC Running</h3>

<p>I will be detailed for my <code>CentOS 6.4 x86_64</code>, for others, refer to <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/User_manual">BOINC User Mannual</a>.</p>

<h4>Check your repos</h4>

<pre><code>ls -al /etc/yum.repos.d/
</code></pre>

<h4>Add EPEL repo</h4>

<pre><code>wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
sudo rmp --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RMP-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6
yum clean all
yum list
</code></pre>

<h4>Install BOINC using yum</h4>

<p>Below is the version for Terminal guys, for more details you may want to refer to <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Installing_BOINC_on_Fedora">Installing BOINC on Fedora</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>boinc-manger</code> is your case if you prefer using GUI for interfacing, however if working under Terminal, <code>boinc-client</code> is enough. I will install both here:</p>

<pre><code>su -c 'yum install boinc-client boinc-manager'
</code></pre>

<p>Make it an auto-start service:</p>

<pre><code>chkconfig boinc-client on
</code></pre>

<p>Verify the installation:</p>

<pre><code>ps aux | grep boinc
</code></pre>

<p>See what has been installed:</p>

<pre><code>which boinc_client | xargs file
which boinc        | xargs file
which boinccmd     | xargs file
which boinc_gui    | xargs file
which boincmgr     | xargs file
</code></pre>

<p>For help:</p>

<pre><code>man boinc
man boinccmd
man boincmgr
</code></pre>

<p>Set up your accounts:</p>

<pre><code>sudo usrmod -G boinc -a your_username
sudo chmod g+rw /var/lib/boinc
sudo chmod g+rw /var/lib/boinc/*.*
sudo ln -s /var/lib/boinc/gui_rpc_auth.cfg ~/gui_rpc_auth.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, <strong>logout and login again</strong> to renew your groupship and permission to /var/lib/boinc.</p>

<h4>Attach WCG project to BOINC</h4>

<pre><code>boinccmd --project_attach http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/ YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY
boinccmd update
</code></pre>

<p><code>YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY</code> can be found at your <code>WCG Profile</code>.</p>

<h4>Check the BOINC status</h4>

<pre><code>boinccmd --get_state
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h3>Register Ripple Wallet</h3>

<p>Go to <a href="https://ripple.com">ripple website</a> and register a wallet. Do remember the related keys for security.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Connect your WCG and Ripple Wallet</h3>

<p>Finally, go to <a href="https://www.computingforgood.org">Computing for Good</a> and get your <code>WCG</code> and <code>Ripple Wallet</code> connected.</p>

<p>Just click <code>REGISTER</code>, the guide will get you done very soon, all you need to do is to provide the specified <code>wallet address</code> and <code>WCG account</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/12/making-your-slides-the-awesome-way/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-12T00:08:45+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/12/making-your-slides-the-awesome-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People will always find themselves making varies of slides for demo or promotion or report, whatever. Most would know how to make a slide ,right? <code>PPT</code> would be the first choice to majority of people. For web developers, they would produce their slides in <code>HTML + CSS + Javascript</code>? And for researchers or people in academic area, will they use <code>Latex</code> or the popular <code>beamer</code> class?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>We do have kinds of approaches to make us slids work, but what is the awesome way? To be awesome, I mean the sides should look nice, easy to control its typeset and should maintain the same when playing at different devices or different software. Of course, the way to write your slide could be awesome too:&ndash;)</p>

<p>I will simply go through what choices that we have, what&rsquo;s the advantage disadvantage, and finally choose the way that you think is awesome to you.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Choices for making slides</h3>

<h4>The normal way &ndash; PPT or Keynote</h4>

<p>I bet that this is the most adaptive way for people to get presentations done. On Windows and Linux, we use Office, specifically speaking the <code>Powerpoint</code> or <code>Impress</code> shipped with LibreOffice.</p>

<p>On Mac, people use <code>Keynote</code> a lot.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t make it long, see this for a fabulous discussion at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://readingsml.blogspot.com/2009/11/keynote-vs-powerpoint-vs-beamer.html">Keynote vs. Powerpoint vs. Beamer</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Cool way utilizing browser &ndash; HTML + CSS</h4>

<p>Yes, yes, we only need Browers and Terminals for our computer, right? Exaggerated enough, but browsers are really doing everything for us, including showing the slides, go to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net">slideshare</a> for a vivid experience. However, the slides showed on <code>slideshare</code> is powered by <code>Flash</code>, so do others who provide similar services.</p>

<p>No Flash, let&rsquo;s see how to make slides using just <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code>.</p>

<p>A good tutorial goes here:</p>

<li><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-create-presentation-slides-with-html-and-css-2/">How to Create Presentation Slides with HTML and CSS</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Awesome way using Latex &ndash; beamer</h4>

<p>Geek enough, but maybe mostly used by hackers and researchers, Latex &ndash; beamer is definitely awesome. It&rsquo;s like you are composing a literature when writing your slides.</p>

<p>For getting started with Latex &ndash; beamer, See:</p>

<hr />

<h3>Awesome way for making slides</h3>

<p>To me, the awesome would be to use <code>HTML + CSS</code> or <code>beamer</code>. Why? Simply because they are cross platform naturely and it&rsquo;s really flexible when creating slides by writing plain markup files or something like that.</p>

    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/06/linux-getting-started-methodologies-and-practices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is basically a topic that I gave to <a href="http://blog-ossclub.rhcloud.com/">Open-CAS</a> group members as a technique share. Since I have known Linux for over 4 years and heavily used it for 2 years more or less, I find myself realy attracted by it.</p>

<p>Also I want others to have the chance to live with a better OS(Unix and Linux, also Mac OS of course), so it&rsquo;s a good time to take the good points out of my mind and let more people know.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to learn from each other especially when there are problems to solve. So I put my mind at a <code>github</code> repo called <a href="https://github.com/hustcalm/linux-getting-started">linux-getting-started</a> and hope that others would join me to make this repo more useful.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What&rsquo;s in this repo</h3>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m addressing two aspects for <code>Linux Getting Started</code>, namely <code>Methodologies</code> and <code>Practices</code>. I know these are really big words, but they just fit here since I want to tell people <code>how to learn</code> not just <code>what to learn</code>.</p>

<h4>Methodologies</h4>

<p>Know what you are gonna do before you step out. Basically, for Linux beginners, the first step that I recommend is <code>install a Linux distro that you like</code>. Then just <code>use it</code> before you want to know everything about it(seems that no one will never ever). It&rsquo;s an OS after all, you use it for your daily job and solve your problems, not a magic software that just plays magic.</p>

<p>A good book would give you a real quick start, I have divided the books into three levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Beginner]</li>
</ul>


<p>Newbies who just get to know Linux &ndash; Learn how to live with shell</p>

<ul>
<li>[Developer]</li>
</ul>


<p>Experienced programmers especially for C/C++ guys &ndash; get used to Linux Platform</p>

<ul>
<li>[Next]</li>
</ul>


<p>Ones who will dive deeper into the most complicated but fun part &ndash; Kernel and Driver</p>

<p><strong>In one word, use it, learn it, dive into it!</strong></p>

<h4>Practices</h4>

<p>Using and Reading will give a quite well understanding for Linux, but not enough for mastering it. To become <code>real Linux users or developers</code>, remember <code>never leave your eyes off the screen and your fingers off your keyboard</code>, practice will just make perfect things and a great Linuxer, believe me:&ndash;)</p>

<p>I address two technical parts currently in this repo, <code>Shell Scripting</code> and <code>Makefile</code>. Other parts will definitely added as long as I maintain this repo.</p>

<h5>Shell Scripting</h5>

<p>Before beginning with <code>Shell Scripting</code>, I suppose you have already been familiar with varies of commands or utilities in shell.</p>

<p>To be straight, <code>shell</code> itself is a program which will interpret user&rsquo;s commands or instructions, convert them to <code>system calls</code> or other things that OS can understand. So basically speaking, <code>shell</code> is the interface between <code>user</code> and <code>OS Kernel</code>.</p>

<p>As a script language, it has its own variables, functions and flow control statements, also it features many other stuff which will ease much pain for system administration but maybe worse if not used properly. When we are writing shell scripts, we are actually dealing with processes and interprocess communication, each process would do its job and we can use <code>pipe</code>, <code>socket</code>, <code>named-pipes</code> or <code>file</code> to let them talk to each other.</p>

<p>You can definitely play some magic with shell scripting by choosing your favorite shell, like <code>Bash</code>, <code>Ksh</code>, <code>Zsh</code>, etc.</p>

<h5>Makefile</h5>

<p>As you get to know <code>shell</code>, you are ready to know something about <code>makefile</code>. Before that, I will talk about <code>make</code>, <code>autotools</code> first.</p>

<p>When we are trying to build a big project, no one want to invoke every single compiling commands by hand which is annoying but also error prone. Here comes <code>make</code> to figure out this problem. So when you download a package with source code, to build it, simply type:</p>

<pre><code>make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Then you are done!</p>

<p>Is this that easy? Reality will really disappoint us, because the user&rsquo;s OS or environment always will not be consistent with the developer&rsquo;s. So <code>make</code> does not easy the pain for buiding a package or software from scratch, but making it easier to manage a big project.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution? Here comes the <code>Autotools</code>, which will generate <code>makefiles</code> automatically according to the configuration of your system. Like you got a third party library A, and one package needs the library for one feature, <code>Autotools</code> will take care of whether you got the library installed, if yes, then build the package with the feature enabled, or just disable it otherwise.</p>

<p>Cool, isn&rsquo;t it? Yes for the users, but maybe no for the developers, I mean all the pain will be transfered to the developers since they got to write <code>Autotools</code> scripts to make things right. Just another wrapper to give a good, cross-platform and generic solution? Some people would quite agree with this opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <code>Autotools</code>, people are getting used to:</p>

<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>There are many others excellent build systems or tools out there, like <code>CMake</code>, <code>QMake</code>, <code>Scons</code>, <code>Ninja</code> ,etc. Go and try them out!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Where is the slide</h3>

<p>Honestly speaking, the slide is just a chain which helps me to make a clear topic. So you will not find it big, just about 15 pages, however to spread all the sparking mind, you will find it&rsquo;s really a <code>big one</code> again.</p>

<p>If you want, download the slide at <a href="https://github.com/hustcalm/linux-getting-started/blob/master/linux-getting-started-%40hustcalm.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>What if I want to see something else</h3>

<p>Cool, buddy, I do hope that we can maintain this repo together and help more people to get started with Linux. So you are welcome to add interesting topics or useful links or good references or books to this repo.</p>

<p>You may either <code>fork</code> this <a href="https://github.com/hustcalm/linux-getting-started">repo</a>, add something interesting, then <code>pull request</code> to me.</p>

<p>Or you can just add what you want to know to the <code>wishList</code> file after <code>fork</code>, maybe shortly I will add stuff about the topic that you care about.</p>

<p>Help others, help yourself:&ndash;)</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/02/getting-started-with-qt-and-qt-creator/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-02T15:42:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/01/02/getting-started-with-qt-and-qt-creator</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&rsquo;m doing a project for the Lab and choose C++ as the programming language, but for the Framework, I considered MFC and Qt at first but choose Qt without hesitation as soon as I recalled the pains when I tried to play with MFC. In short, MFC is just showing too much to the developer and looks a little annoying and more complicated(C++ itself is complicated enough).</p>

<p>To be clear, I did not try Qt before either and totally new to it. But after two months, I wrote a running application which can deal with Cameras, IMU and Inclinometer, also a 6DOF controller. Besides, we have multithreading in it and multiply timers are running simultaneously. To summarize what I have learned and also share my experience to you is the desire to write this post.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I also find that Qt Creator is really cool with the plugin <code>FakeVim</code> enabled(It is installed by default ,at least in my Qt Creator 2.8.1 Windows version), a light wight IDE with powerful abilities! So in this post, after talking about how to get started with Qt, I will give some appreciations to Qt Creator:&ndash;)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Beginning with Qt</h3>

<h4>Get to know Qt</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a GUI toolkit when fist designed, but after years of development, it has evolved into a framework which is cross platform and popular.</p>

<p>For official introduction, visit <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt Project</a>.</p>

<h4>Choosing the way that you use</h4>

<p>I will not talk about the versions ,like 5.x or 4.x. Let&rsquo;s say something about the <code>prebuilt-binaries</code> and <code>source code</code>.</p>

<p>If you choose to build from scratch, it would take a bit of time to do that since Qt is big enough. If using the built binaries, do look at the related compilor, for Windows, you got options for VS 2008, VS 2010, VS 2012 and MinGW stuff. If you are using VS 2008(in my case), choosing this file <a href="http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.5/qt-win-opensource-4.8.5-vs2008.exe">Qt libraries 4.8.5 for Windows (VS 2008, 235 MB)</a>, just for an example,then probably you are good to go when you build your project with VS 2008 as the backend.</p>

<p>For Qt Creator, I prefer to use the perbuilt one too, but if you want to install some specified plugins, build from source code may be needed.</p>

<h4>A good book would help a lot</h4>

<p>I read the book <code>C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4(2nd Edition)</code> not because it&rsquo;s the best book for Qt, just because that we got one Chinese version copy of the book in our Lab. I went through the first 3 chapters and the appendix(mainly to know more about <code>qmake</code>), then referenced other chapters while I got problems when coding.</p>

<p>For the comment that I wrote for the book, you can find it <a href="http://book.douban.com/review/6489896/">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, this book is recommended as the official Qt book. You may want to try it out yourself and make your own judge, if you find another excellent book, do let me know:&ndash;)</p>

<h4>See what the official says</h4>

<p>For the official tutorials, you can refer to their website, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/gettingstarted.html">Getting Started with Qt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/how-to-learn-qt.html">How to Learn Qt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.7/how-to-learn-qt.html">How to Learn Qt</a></li>
</ul>


<p>You may notice that each Qt version got their own getting started web page, however, don&rsquo;t bother, checkout them all and pick the brilliant part that suits yourself.</p>

<p>As time goes by, there may be new links and the listed links would be out of date. Go to the official website and find the real links then.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Qt Creator as your Swiss Army Knife</h3>

<p>Yes, it is just an IDE, compared with Eclipse, it&rsquo;s dedicated to Qt and C++(Not exactly, it supports Android and even BlackBerry development), so much light-wighted. However, it&rsquo;s flexible and with lots of plugins, see <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_Creator_Plug-in_Gallery">Qt Creator Plugin Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m not expert to Qt Creator either, I will give several examples here.</p>

<h4>FakeVim</h4>

<p>Default shipped with Qt Creator, I&rsquo;m really excited when I find it. Support external <code>.vimrc</code> and give you almost the native vim experience.</p>

<p>I used the default <code>FakeVim</code> key bindings, they are just as same as the official vim, besides that, you may use other short cuts provided by Qt Creator, among them, <code>F2</code> for following the symbol under cursor and <code>F4</code> for switching header and souce file are the most frequently used. For generating source code tags, it&rsquo;s well cared by a background process, however when got large source files, I suffered for temporary <code>Not Responding</code>.</p>

<p>For quick view of the options:
<img src="http://hustcalm.me/images/blog_images/qt_creator-fakevim.png"></p>

<h4>Doxygen</h4>

<p>This plugin uses the standard <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> as the backend and give useful utilities for documenting the whole project or a file or a class, function. variable, whatever.</p>

<p>The following links really help a lot:o</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://facwiki.cs.byu.edu/HCMI/index.php/Using_doxygen_with_Qt_Creator">Using doxygen with Qt Creator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dev.kofee.org/projects/qtcreator-doxygen/wiki">QtCreator-Doxygen</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Version Control</h4>

<p>Qt Creator makes it really easy for integrating with version control tools, an image will tell everything:

<p>Hope this post do a little help for your getting started with Qt Programming:&ndash;)</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/12/21/c-slash-c-plus-plus-bu-si-de-jing-ling/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-21T13:18:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/12/21/c-slash-c-plus-plus-bu-si-de-jing-ling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>看了《C专家编程》和《Essential C++》后，对C/C++的好奇愈加强烈。作为平台级别的语言，很多操作系统都是基于C/C++构建的，因此要想学好C/C++，我觉得对系统底层的了解是必须的，至少对于一个真正的Programmer需要做到如此。总有一些言论，说现在C/C++程序员都成稀有群体了，现在大家都去玩简单易学的Python，甚至时髦小众的Golang了。呜呼，我想说，C/C++伴我们一路走来，作为不死之精灵，还将陪我们走一段很长的路。</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>前言</h3>

<p>不管是业界惯性也罢，语言本身也好，我觉得这个世界对C/C++的需求是巨大的。底层的操作系统不说，对效率要求极高的游戏产品，大型科学计算程序，都是C/C++的绝佳用武之地。Java提供的JNI机制，一个是从平台本地化考虑，另外一个很大程度上是从效率上考虑的吧。Windows Phone的开发以C#作为GUI主要语言，底层的component大多基于C++编译出来的lib。OOP虽然早在Ada，Smalltalk就被引入，不过真正带给产业届震撼的应该是在C++被发明出来以后。当然这跟一些业界巨头的选择不无关系，比如Microsoft选择了C++作为自己的底层开发语言。</p>

<p>写这篇文章，实则是想让自己整理一下学习的思路，如果能给读者带来一些启发，定倍感荣幸了。从C/C++说起，牵涉到底层的OS实现，Compilor实现，语言本身的描述，CRT，glibc之类的概念，以及ISO标准，Windows API，system call之流。缕清楚了底层的复杂机制，在写C/C++程序的时候会更加成竹在胸了，实现和调试上都会更有针对性和效率。而谈到应用程序的设计，则需要用到各种各样的库，在这些库之上构建程序的功能逻辑，这本质上算是代码重用了。话说回来，在整个计算机开发界，我觉得人类就是不断地向高层抽象，从机器代码到汇编，再到编译型的C/C++语言，动态解释性语言，再往后肯定会有更抽象的语言出现，也许那个时候，人类不是自己编程了，而是计算机自己编程，而人类只需要告诉它需要完成什么任务就行了。Ok，就暂时YY到这里。</p>

<p>既然是整理思路的文章，我准备按照自底向上的方式，进行一些简单的讨论，中间参考了大量的已有博文，我会简单总结一下博文的精神，如果想自己消化，就请移步原文了。</p>

<hr />

<h3>C/C++，Compilor， OS，CRT，Standard Library，API之我见</h3>

<p>感觉很难有几个程序员可以很快把这个几个概念说清楚。这些东东都很有历史，所以一路伴随计算机走来的人会有比较深入的了解。在引入讨论前，我先谈谈自己的体会。</p>

<p>从计算机说起，它到底是个什么东东？A magic Box？Yes，but No！本质上来说，都是“开关”，几个”开关“可以构成”逻辑“，而”逻辑“的”组合“可以做事了。而这个开关的实现就跟技术水平有关系了。最开始的”开关”是用机械装置实现的，到后来是电子管，再到后来是ASIC和VLSI了。</p>

<p>而计算机最核心的部件就属“CPU”了，真正的worker就是它。而CPU的设计也相对单纯，它只负责如实地访问相应的寄存器存取数据，并且取指后执行指令。为了运行逻辑复杂的大型程序，则需要外部存储的辅助，那就是RAM了。而为了持久化，就又需要Hard Disk的帮忙。</p>

<p>所以计算机本身就是一堆电子元器件的组合，但是想做出可以工作的，有用的计算机，其中的细节都是很专业的事情。</p>

<h4>C/C++</h4>

<p>语言本身是一种标准或者描述，说明语言有哪些要素，能够实现哪些功能等等，因此它本身可以在比较短的篇幅内讲完，所以C语言之父Ritchie的著作《The C Programming Language》只有不到200页。</p>

<h4>Compilor</h4>

<p>真正实现语言特性和功能的是编译器，由于语言本身的描述有些地方不是特别死板，或者很多地方跟所用的平台有关系，编译器在实现的时候也会有略微的差异。举个最直观的例子，Microsoft的MSVC和GNU的gcc，甚至SUN的cc，对你写的同一份C/C++源代码会有自身的一些特殊处理。</p>

<p>说到了编译器，就再说一下抽象层这个事情吧。大家可能都知道，最开始的编程使用机器语言，后来到了汇编语言，由汇编器完成中间的翻译工作。后来出现了高级语言，比如C语言（其实在之前有很多其它的语言，C语言不是最早却是最成功的），这个时候由编译器把源代码处理后编译成汇编代码，再由汇编器翻译成机器代码。至于之后的动态语言，比如Python，也是先要使用一种语言实现一个解释器，然后再通过这个解释器来运行用户的脚本或者代码。居于中间的另外一种语言形式可以拿Java举例子，它本身具有静态语言和动态语言的特点，而这一切都是由JVM（Java Virtual Machine）带来的。</p>

<p>纵观几种语言形态，可以发现一种典型的分层结构，源代码->（中间代码）-> 汇编代码 &ndash;> 机器代码。 扯一句淡，“任何的软件问题，都可以通过增加一层抽象层解决”。呵呵。</p>

<h4>OS</h4>

<p>提到Operating System（OS），大多数人可能很快想到Windows，Linux，Mac OS之类，会有少部分专业人员可能会直接想到Kernel。拿Linux来说，它本身就是指代一个操作系统内核的，说到Linux系统，则更为正式的称呼是GNU/Linux，而大家平常用的是各种Linux发行版（Linux Distro）。</p>

<p>OS做了什么？概括地来说，它是用户和硬件资源之间的一个接口，如果只有一个裸机放在用户面前，它本身是没有多少用处的（如果你想在它上面编辑一个文本文档，估计要自己写不少代码先），这个时候需要一个中间层，它能够替代用户管理裸机的各种硬件和资源，呈现给用户一个友好的，可用的，可操作的界面（嗯，就是图形用户界面或者终端界面了）。</p>

<p>那问题来了。OS是用什么写的？最开始的Linux是用C语言和内嵌汇编写的，现代的Windows是用C++写的，至于最开始Multics等鼻祖，我个人推测应该是纯汇编或者使用比较早期的高级语言吧（B语言？）。</p>

<p>那操作系统作为资源总管，需要提供相应的应用程序接口（API）给用户程序使用啊，否则操作系统只管资源，不让大家用，岂有此理！这就是传说中的系统调用（system call）？而且访问资源的时候，用户程序也不能胡来，那就分个界限吧，这就是我们常说的用户态和内核态（User space &amp;&amp; Kernel Space）？对应于CPU的目态和管态？</p>

<p>然而，切换是有开销的。</p>

<h4>CRT</h4>

<p>通俗地来说，应该讲讲Run Time。拿C语言来说，你的程序是从main开始执行的吗？从用户的角度来看，是的;但是从操作系统的角度，不是的。在你的程序能够正常工作之前，有太多的工作需要做，这就是runtime library需要负责的事情，大体上主要是I/O初始化以及内存的分配等等。</p>

<p>这又与应用程序的装载产生了联系，具体的细节一时半会也讲不清楚了。</p>

<h4>Stanard Library</h4>

<p>有了runtime library后，比如说有了C运行时，那么你用C语言写的代码，经过编译链接之后，可以正常运行，但前提是你必须使用C运行时提供的一些函数接口以及你自定义的一些函数接口。然而，在我们的日常事务处理中，有太多的操作是重复性的，可以被抽象出来给大家使用的，这就是语言标准库的由来？在遵循语言标准的基础之上，把一组常用的，通用的操作通过高效的实现写成接口库供用户调用。这无疑对生产力是一个巨大的提升，因为这样一来，你不必再去花心思想着如何去打开一个文件的实现细节了，你只需要用标准库的fopen即可。</p>

<p>像C语言的&lt;stdio.h>，&lt;stdlib.h>就是标准函数库提供的头文件。C++则在兼容C语言的基础之上有自己的标准库，还有大名鼎鼎的STL（Standard Template Library，已经被纳入C++标准）。</p>

<h4>API</h4>

<p>即应用程序接口（Application Interface），然而它本身也是一个普适的概念。在分层的软件架构中，下层提供给上层的接口都可以统称为API（我的个人理解）。</p>

<p>再泛化地来讲，可能需要大家认真去琢磨Interface这个概念了（硬件上，软件上，面向对象上，等等）。</p>

<hr />

<h3>看看他们怎么说</h3>

<p>网上关于CRT，Standard Library，OS的综合讨论并不太多，这里我挑几个典型的分析，简单概括一下原作者的看法。如果跟原文的意思有出入，请原作者包涵啦:&ndash;)</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/22642/What-Every-Computer-Programmer-Should-Know-About-W#ContentsofC++StandardLibrary">What Every Computer Programmer Should Know About Windows API, CRT, and the Standard C++ Library</a></h4>

<p>一篇深入浅出的文章，虽然是以Windows平台为例，但是读者大可以举一反三，先来看张作者给出的图片：</p>

<p><img src="http://hustcalm.me/images/blog_images/relationship-between-windowsAPI-CRT-and-C++StandardLibrary.png"></p>

<p>典型的分层架构，清晰明了，虽然还有很多细节值得商榷，但是直观上的理解却是可以这样的。</p>

<p>之后作者还提到了Unicode的细节处理，C++标准库，跨平台，代码复用（静态链接 VS 动态链接）等，是一篇搞清基本概念的入门好文！</p>

<p>读英文有困难的同学，可以移步本文的中文版<a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/menggucaoyuan/archive/2011/06/09/2075910.html">程序员应该知道的关于Windows API、CRT和STL二三事</a>。</p>

<h4><a href="http://blog.csdn.net/lvan100/article/details/7687359">Windows API和C运行时库CRT的关系</a></h4>

<p>感觉本文的作者总是在纠结于<code>先有鸡还是先有蛋</code>的问题，而且对多平台的理解不够深入，更多的是被Windows这个平台限制住了。</p>

<p>C语言本身肯定是与平台无关的，当它跟平台有关的时候就是各个操作系统厂商实现C语言编译器和运行时以及标准库的时候了。操作系统本身用什么写都是可以的，因为最终都要编制成二进制的机器代码，而在开发操作系统的时候用到什么库之类的，则要依赖于开发操作系统本身的平台支持了。又回到了那个问题，在没有出现高级语言之前，大部分软件组件肯定是前辈们用汇编搞定，包括C语言编译器（当然也可能是其它的初级高级语言），一旦实现了成套的基础设施（编译器，链接器，装载器等），再利用这些构建工具去制造现代的软件就是顺理成章的事情了。</p>

<p>这里大家需要搞清楚的是，不管你的源代码写的是什么，计算机只认识机器代码，更加严格的是0和1。</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/chio/archive/2007/11/26/972152.html">C Runtime Library来历, API, MFC, ATL关系</a></h4>

<p>在转贴关于C Runtime Library之前的讨论感觉像是在鬼扯，<code>CRT原先是指Microsoft开发的C Runtime Library，用于操作系统的开发及运行</code>，看到这一句，基本注定以下的讨论可以停止了。</p>

<p>分割线下面的关于一些基本概念的解释有一定的可取之处，大家直接看分割线下面的即可，否则被上面那一部分耽误了！</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/aguncn/archive/2012/11/12/2766520.html">我自己关于C语言，编译器，标准库，GUN glibc,CRT ，API之类的理解。</a></h4>

<p>作者本人好像对这些概念也停留在一知半解的状态，因此上面的就当看看即可。下面的链接比较有可取之处，给出了C/C++标准库和运行时库的一些链接，首先是标准（出自ISO），之后分别给出了Microsoft和GNU的实现。</p>

<p>如果把文章那些有用的链接抽取出来，这篇文章就不用看了。有用的链接我在下面的资源整理中会给出原出处。</p>

<p><strong>总结：</strong></p>

<p>总得看来，第一篇文章的分析较有说服力，用词专业，对概念的解释也很清晰，但是作为入门级别的文章很难再把问题说得更加具体;而后面的文章的个人见解部分实在不敢恭维，而有用的部分大多又是转载其它文章的只言片语，因此不推荐大家看。</p>

<p>如果想弄清楚以上的概念和相互的关系，大家不必翻箱倒柜找各种文章了，直接看《程序员的自我修养-链接，装载与库》这本书好了。《程序员的自我修养》把程序的结构，编译，链接，装载，运行时之类的概念进行了深入的剖析，并且附带很生动的例子，中间还不时穿插编程中可能困惑你好久的小问题。写这篇文章的时候，我看完了第一部分，暂时跳过了第二，第三部分，正在看第四部分，感觉此书是深入理解系统底层奥秘的绝佳捷径！</p>

<hr />

<h3>C/C++资源一览</h3>

<p>正如C++之父Stroustrup所鼓励的，用库去扩展语言，而保持语言本身的简洁。所以除了C++标准库以外，出现了大量的第三方库，涉及程序开发的各个领域，可谓是百花齐放！</p>

<p>下面给出几个比较好的链接，每一个都值得大家阅读。</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.csdn.net/netlinux/article/details/6700505">C/C++ 类库开发库参考</a></li>

<hr />

<h3>如何学习C/C++</h3>

<p>跟任何一门编程语言一样，大量的练习是必不可少的，但是在练习开始之前，我觉得首先要找到一个比较高效的方法。根据我个人的经验，比较好的学习方式是：</p>

<ul>
<li><p>找到一个学习的需求，为了学习而学习可能只会走马观花，如果实在没有什么需求，那就从写一个实用的小软件开始吧。</p></li>
<li><p>找到正确的入门书籍，谭老师的那本书我是强烈不推荐的，推荐看C语言三剑客《C和指针》，《C陷阱和缺陷》和《C专家编程》。C++的话，个人觉得《Essential C++》适合入门，C++ Primer适合当成参考书籍，其它的《Effective C++》等还没看过，不敢乱说。</p></li>
<li><p>边看边练，加深理解，拿指针为例，一定在从对应的内存关系去理解，就会感觉很自然，它不过是一个整形变量，指代一个内容地址而已;而变量本身就是某一个内存地址的抽象表示嘛。而不管指针的指针，还是什么，顺着下去也就比较好理解了，只是关系繁杂的时候需要仔细缕清楚。</p></li>
<li><p>基本熟悉之后，可以去试试一些框架，比如Qt，体会一下框架是如何在C++之上给开发者抽象了一层应用开发层的。</p></li>
<li><p>后面的，自行发挥想象力吧:&ndash;)</p></li>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/12/10/notes-about-ieee-1394-avt-cameras-firepackage-and-opencv/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-10T21:10:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/12/10/notes-about-ieee-1394-avt-cameras-firepackage-and-opencv</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make AVT 1394 Cameras work with OpenCV using the standard <code>VideoCapture</code> recently but got no luck. Briefly speaking, OpenCV&rsquo;s support for camera input are <code>Operating System</code> and <code>Device Driver</code> aware.</p>

<p>In this post, I will give some basic related concepts related to Firewire(aka IEEE 1394) and AVT software packages, also OpenCV&rsquo;s <code>VideoCapture</code> workflow.</p>

<!--more-->


<hr />

<h3>FireWire</h3>

<p>Aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394">IEEE 1394</a>, it&rsquo;s a serial bus interface standard for high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data transfer, developed by <code>Apple</code> in early 1990s and called <code>FireWire</code>. The main competitor nowadays is <code>USB</code>.</p>

<p>For the official introduction part, you can refer to the wikipedia link above, I want to address two points here.</p>

<h4>Standards and versions</h4>

<p>The most used must be <code>1394a</code> and <code>1394b</code>, and to make things work, do pay some attention to your <code>1394 Host Controller</code>.</p>

<p>Unlike USB and USB 2.0, the physical interface between 1394a and 1394b is significantly different. As such, users will need to acquire cables with a 1394a (4-pin or 6-pin) connector on one end and a 1394b (9-pin) connector on the other. And a 1394a device would work connecting to a 1394b bus whereas one would fail vice versa.</p>

<h4>Pins of connector</h4>

<p>As for <code>1394a</code> and <code>1394b</code>, there are three kinds of connectors used: 4-pin, 6-pin and 9-pin. Hence there are kinds of cables connecting different styles of connectors list blow:</p>

<p><img src="http://connector.pinouts.ru/diagram/firewire_cable.gif" alt="FireWire Plug Connector at the cable" />.</p>

<p>Luck is you may get whatever cable to fullfil your need as long as you are connecting your device to a right bus.</p>

<p>For more details about the interface pinout, read this article <a href="http://pinouts.ru/Slots/ieee1394_pinout.shtml">FireWire (IEEE1394) bus interface pinout</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>AVT Cameras</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.alliedvisiontec.com">AVT</a> does manufacture so many cameras and provide great technical support. It&rsquo;s kind of a choice for you to choose between the software packages,seriously speaking.</p>

<h4>AVT Software Selector</h4>

<p>Now they are focusing on <a href="http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/apac/products/software/vimba-sdk.html">VIMBA</a> and maintain it actively.</p>

<p>However for the legacy ones, like <code>FirePackage</code>, <code>Universal Package</code>, etc, look into this link <a href="http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/de/produkte/legacy.html">Legacy Software (SDKs, Apps, Adapters, and Interfaces)</a>.</p>

<p>To select the software that suits you, refer to these links:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/apac/support/downloads/software.html">AVT Software Support</a></li>
<li><a href="http://1stvision.com/avt_downloads.htm">AVT Software Downloads for AVT Cameras</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/fileadmin/content/PDF/Software/AVT_software/AVT_software_stuff/AVTSoftwareSelectorGuide_v3.3.0.pdf">AVT Software Selector Guide</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Inside FirePackage</h4>

<p>Although called legacy SDKs, FirePackage is widely used currently. For the main idea, you can give quick glimps for the documentation after installation and get a basic knowledge of <code>FireClass</code>, <code>FireCtrl</code>, <code>FireGrab</code> and <code>FireStack</code>.</p>

<p>For the package architecture,see this:
<img src="http://hustcalm.me/images/blog_images/architecture_of_AVT_FirePackage.png"></p>

<h4>AVT and OpenCV</h4>

<p>Bad luck that we can&rsquo;t use AVT cameras just with <code>VideoCapture</code> because that the cameras might use a device driver that OpenCV can&rsquo;t talk to.</p>

<p>However if your camera compliants with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/">CMU 1394 Digital Camera Driver</a>, probably you will be happy again:&ndash;)</p>

<hr />

<h3>OpenCV and Cameras</h3>

<p>Quote from this post <a href="https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/tutorials/camera/getting_started">Getting Started with OpenCV capturing</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Currently two camera interfaces can be used on Windows: Video for Windows (VFW) and Matrox Imaging Library (MIL) and two on Linux: Video for Linux(V4L) and IEEE1394. For the latter there exists two implemented interfaces (CvCaptureCAM_DC1394_CPP and CvCapture_DC1394V2).</p></blockquote>

<p>Generaly speaking, your camera would probably work if it is <code>VFW</code> or <code>MIL</code> compliant under Windows or it suits to standard <code>V4L</code> or <code>IEEE1394</code> driver model.</p>

<p>But if not, you can even sub-class the <code>VideoCapture</code> class, and implement your camera driver to make it work seamlessly with OpenCV.</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/11/14/httplib-httplib2-urllib-urllib2-whats-the-difference/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-14T11:24:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/11/14/httplib-httplib2-urllib-urllib2-whats-the-difference</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lots of people may got confused by the Python modules- <code>httplib, httplib2, urllib, urllib2</code>. Judge from their names, we may prefer the x2 module because they may be version 2 of the module and should work better. Maybe you are right for some degree(as for the httplib).</p>

<p>However, things are a little bit complicated which needs a brief explanation indeed.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What&rsquo;s the claim</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s see what a specified module&rsquo;s aim. I will quote from the official site:&ndash;)</p>

<h3>httplib</h3>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html">Here</a> is a link from <code>The Python Standard Library</code> for <code>Python 2.7.6</code>.</p>

<pre><code>This module defines classes which implement the client side of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. 
It is normally not used directly — the module urllib uses it to handle URLs that use HTTP and HTTPS.
</code></pre>

<h3>httplib2</h3>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">This</a> is the official website hosted on <code>Google Code</code>. It claims:</p>

<pre><code>A comprehensive HTTP client library that supports many features left out of other HTTP libraries.
</code></pre>

<p>and the <code>Project Goal</code>:</p>

<pre><code>To become a worthy addition to the standard Python library.
</code></pre>

<p>It features <code>HTTP and HTTPS</code>, <code>Keep-Alive</code>, <code>Authentication</code>(support <em>Digest</em>, <em>Basic</em>, <em>WSSE</em>, <em>HMAC Digest</em> and <em>Google Account Authentication</em>), <code>Caching</code>, <code>All Methods</code>, <code>Redirects</code>, <code>Compression</code>, <code>Lost update support</code> and <code>Unit Tested</code>.</p>

<h3>urllib</h3>

<p>Quote from <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>This module provides a high-level interface for fetching data across the World Wide Web. 
In particular, the urlopen() function is similar to the built-in function open(), but accepts Universal Resource Locators (URLs) instead of filenames.  
Some restrictions apply — it can only open URLs for reading, and no seek operations are available.
</code></pre>

<h3>urllib2</h3>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html">The Standard Python Library</a> stats that:</p>

<pre><code>The urllib2 module defines functions and classes which help in opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world — basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more.
It's an extensible library for opening URLs.
</code></pre>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the difference</h2>

<h3>httplibx and urllibx</h3>

<p><code>urllib/urllib2</code> is built on top of <code>httplib</code>. It offers more features than writing to <code>httplib</code> directly.
However, <code>httplib</code> gives you finer control over the underlying connections.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re dealing solely with HTTP/HTTPs and need access to HTTP specific stuff, use httplib.
For all other cases, use urllibx(note that <code>urllib and urllib2</code> have different capabilities, thus are always used together).</p>

<h3>httplib and httplib2</h3>

<p>Basically, httplib2 is <code>Google's python httplib implementation</code> but much more powerful.</p>

<p>They actually do the same things utilizing HTTP/HTTPs and other network protocals like FTP, typically we can call them <code>HTTP client library</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>httplib</code> can&rsquo;t fulfill your need(as if you need the <code>Redirects</code> feature), consider switching to <code>httplib2</code> then.</p>

<p>To make things simpler, I&rsquo;d rather using <code>httplib2</code> as my default <code>HTTP client library</code> for Python.</p>

<h3>urllib and urllib2</h3>

<p>Quote from this post <a href="http://www.hacksparrow.com/python-difference-between-urllib-and-urllib2.html">Python: difference between urllib and urllib2</a>:</p>

<p><code>urllib</code> and <code>urllib2</code> are both Python modules that do URL request related stuff but offer different functionalities. Their two most significant differences are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>urllib2</code> can accept a Request object to set the headers for a URL request, urllib accepts only a URL. That means, you cannot masquerade your User Agent string etc.</li>
<li><code>urllib</code> provides the urlencode method which is used for the generation of GET query strings, urllib2 doesn&rsquo;t have such a function. This is one of the reasons why urllib is often used along with urllib2.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>

<p>The urllib module has been split into parts and renamed in Python 3 to <code>urllib.request</code>, <code>urllib.parse</code>, and <code>urllib.error</code>. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3. Also note that the urllib.urlopen() function has been removed in Python 3 in favor of urllib2.urlopen().</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/11/04/install-centos-6-dot-4-minial-with-grub2-and-a-usb-stick-the-simple-way/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-04T17:08:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/11/04/install-centos-6-dot-4-minial-with-grub2-and-a-usb-stick-the-simple-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What a shame that I failed over and over to just install CentOS 6.4 minimal to my Desktop PC!!!</p>

<p>I got a broken Ubuntu 12.04 on my hand with a working Grub2, cheers:&ndash;) Also, I luckily have a 4 GB USB stick(who esle dosen&rsquo;t,kidding).</p>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>Install CentOS 6.4 minial with Grub2 and a single USB stick, making no bootable USB stick, but do some tricks with the ISO file instead.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, we need a working Grub(or other bootloaders, I use Grub2), a USB Stick with a vfat or ext2 partition and CentOS ISO file.</p>

<h3>Bootloader</h3>

<p>As I have a broken Ubuntu 12.04 and a already working Grub2, I would just go on.</p>

<p>However, you have many choices due to your OS. Such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grub Legacy</li>
<li>Grub4dos</li>
<li>EasyBCD</li>
</ul>


<h3>ISO</h3>

<p>Download it from a mirror that&rsquo;s close enough to you. Check out the <a href="http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/6/isos/x86_64/">Mirror List</a> and I choose <a href="http://mirrors.163.com/centos/6.4/isos/x86_64/">mirrors.163.com</a>.</p>

<p>Save the <code>CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso</code> to your hard drive.</p>

<h3>USB Stick</h3>

<p>According to the CentOS wiki, the installer will recognize ext2 or vfat. I choose vfat in my case.</p>

<p>My device on my Linuxmint shows /dev/sdb and the partition shows /dev/sdb1. Just ensure that you have a VFAT partition, other things don&rsquo;t matter too much really.</p>

<p>To play with device and partitions, you can use <code>fdisk</code> and <code>mkfs.*</code> or other tools that you favor.</p>

<h3>Extract Files</h3>

<p>I put the ISO file under <code>~/Downloads</code>. And I follow the instructions below:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/centos
sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 ~/Downloads/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso /mnt/centos
mkdir /mnt/usbdisk
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usbdisk
cp -r /mnt/centos/isolinux /mnt/centos/images /mnt/usbdisk
sudo umount /mnt/centos
cp ~/Downloads/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso /mnt/usbdisk
sudo umount /mnt/usbdisk
</code></pre>

<p>After this, we have <code>CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso</code>,<code>isolinux</code> and <code>images</code> on our USB Stick.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Now use Grub2 to boot into CentOS installation environment and complete the installation. I have a SATA hard disk locally and do remember <strong>CentOS installer will make your local hard disk to sdb or sdc, but not sda. The USB Stick will be sda during the installation.</strong></p>

<p>To enter Grub2 command line, press <code>SHIFT</code> when your PC boots, or you may miss the menu entry due to <strong>HIDDEN_TIMEOUT</strong> configruration. Then press <code>c</code> to get a command line.</p>

<p>Then follow the instructions below, you may adjust a little to suit your own PC.</p>

<pre><code>linux (hd1,msdos1)/isolinux/vmlinuz
initrd (hd1,msdos1)/isolinux/initrd.img
boot
</code></pre>

<p>When you prompt to select <code>Installation Method</code>, use <code>Hard Drive</code> and select <code>sda1</code>, follow the routine procedures and you are done:&ndash;)</p>

<p><strong>I tried <code>URL Method</code> but failed, either <code>mirrors.163.com</code> nor <code>mirrors.sohu.com</code> would work:&ndash;(</strong></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All the essentials reside in Grub2 and isolinux or you may say bootloader and ISO stuff. Check them out and deep it for deep is the best way to solve varies of problems related to boot, installation and rescue.</p>

<p>You may install by other methods, CD-ROW, bootable USB Stick or whatever you like.</p>

<p>Enjoy the struggling and enjoy the gain!</p>

    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/10/14/playing-with-xen-under-centos6-dot-4-to-build-your-own-vps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, we are under an age called Cloud Computing.</p>

<p>I used to be curious about VPS(Virtual Private Server), how they work, how to build them, etc. As far as I know, AWS, GCE or whatever else solutions depend heavily on Virtualization Technologies and AWS is definitly playing with Xen currently.</p>

<p>I would like very much to have a trial for building my own VPS and blow are my steps doing it. You may need to read some basic wikis about Xen, <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Overview">Xen Overview</a> and <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Beginners_Guide">Xen Beginners Guide</a> should do some help:&ndash;)</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Getting a working Dom0 on Centos6.4</h2>

<h3>Install Centos</h3>

<p>Use whatever way you like, remember a <strong>minimal install</strong> is recommended.</p>

<h3>Install Xen</h3>

<p>Thanks to <strong>Xen4Centos</strong> Project, we can get Xen installed in several simple commands(log in as root).</p>

<pre><code>yum -y update
yum install centos-release-xen
yum install xen
/usr/bin/grub-bootxen.sh
reboot
</code></pre>

<p>After your machine comes to alive, simply type:</p>

<pre><code>uname -r
xl list
</code></pre>

<p>to verify that Xen Dom0 is running.</p>

<h3>Config network</h3>

<p>I use DHCP to get a valid IP for my box and there is a trick if you can&rsquo;t ping each other when two machinea are in the same LAN(probably the routing table is not working for you and just delete the record from your routing table).</p>

<p>As me, for example, my laptop got a IP, say 192.168.0.10 and my VPS got 192.168.0.11, but they can&rsquo;t talk to each:&ndash;(</p>

<p>First, check your routing table,</p>

<pre><code>route
</code></pre>

<p>Then, delete the record that is evil,</p>

<pre><code>route del -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Please substitute the parameters to suite your own networking</strong>.</p>

<p>After that, ping each other,</p>

<pre><code>ping 192.168.0.11
</code></pre>

<p>to verify the networking is good to go.</p>

<p>In order to give our DomUs valid IPs, we may use a network bridge, do as follows:</p>

<pre><code>yum -y install bridge-utils
cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>My modified and working scripts look like this, for ifcfg-xenbr0:</p>

<pre><code>DEVICE=xenbr0
#HWADDR=00:24:E8:46:CC:C9
TYPE=bridge
#UUID=ff0ab497-0303-4dc3-b6f3-4a6cbd90466b
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
</code></pre>

<p>And for ifcfg-eth0:</p>

<pre><code>DEVICE=eth0
HWADDR=00:24:E8:46:CC:C9
TYPE=Ethernet
UUID=ff0ab497-0303-4dc3-b6f3-4a6cbd90466b
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
#BOOTPROTO=dhcp
BRIDGE=xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>For static IP configuration, please refer to Xen wiki page!</strong></p>

<p>Then, make the configuration work:</p>

<pre><code>service network restart
</code></pre>

<p>If you got errors such as <code>error:check cable</code>, do this manualy:</p>

<pre><code>ifup xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>Verify it works by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>ifconfig xenbr0
</code></pre>

<h3>Diable SELinux</h3>

<p>Honestly speaking, I don&rsquo;t know WTF the real reason to do this, but people say <code>SELinux can really interfere with Xen</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
setenforce 0
</code></pre>

<p>You are good to go with a damn working Dom0 and congratulations!</p>

<h2>Bringing Your DomUs Up</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you to use PV or HVM, personally, I prefer to PV due to higher performance. But if you want a Windows(and other OS whose kernel can&rsquo;t be modified), HVM is your only choice.</p>

<p>As for me, I want 3 DomUs, namely Debian, Fedora and Arch Linux.</p>

<h3>Xen4Cli or Xen4Libvirt</h3>

<p>Xen4Cli(xm and xl, currently xm deprecated) are intended for advanced users looking to hand setup the network, the backing filestore and the xen environment. While Xen4Libvirt are for newbies looking for the easiest install path.</p>

<p>I prefer <code>xl</code> since I want to know what exactly is happening, and <code>xl</code> works for Debian and Arch Linux. However for Fedora, <code>Libvert</code> seems to be the right way(using <code>virt-install</code>).</p>

<p>To install Libvirt,</p>

<pre><code>yum install libvirt python-virtinst libvirt-daemon-xen
</code></pre>

<p>After the install, restart your Dom0 machine.</p>

<h3>File or LVM based backend</h3>

<p>Since Centos6.4 is shipped perfectly with LVM and also the default partition schema using LVM during OS Installation, I prefer <code>LVM</code>.</p>

<p>As for me, I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>lvresize -L -200G vg_centos6/lv_home -r
lvcreate -L 30G -n fedora vg_centos6
lvcreate -L 30G -n debian vg_centos6
lvcreate -L 30G -n archlinux vg_centos6
</code></pre>

<p>Then verify the Logical Volumes using:</p>

<pre><code>lvdisplay
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>lvs
</code></pre>

<p>If you are not familiar with LVM, search Google for a good tutorial first.</p>

<h3>Bridge, Routing or NAT</h3>

<p>Three networking modes are provided and choose one according to your own networking environment.</p>

<p>I got bridge working for me as described in above section.</p>

<p>For choosing other modes, you can modify <code>/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</code> or explicitly passing as parameters when creating DomUs.</p>

<h3>Let DomUs fly</h3>

<h4>Debian</h4>

<p>I choose debian7.1 netinst.iso due to my poor bandwidth,</p>

<pre><code>wget -c http://mirrors.sohu.com/debian-cd/7.1.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-7.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso
mount -o loop /path/to/debian-7.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso /mnt/debian
cp /mnt/debian/install.amd/xen/debian.cfg /etc/xen/
cd /etc/xen/
vi debian.cfg  ## Make modifications according to the comments
xl create -c debian.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Then install Debian as a very normal one.</p>

<h4>Arch Linux</h4>

<p>I download archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://mirrors.sohu.com/archlinux/iso/latest/archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a arch.cfg file in <code>/etc/xen/</code> similar like:</p>

<pre><code># Refer to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xen#Configuring_a_paravirtualized_.28PV.29_Arch_domU

name = "arch"
kernel = "/mnt/arch/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz"
ramdisk = "/mnt/arch/arch/boot/x86_64/archiso.img"
extra = "archisobasedir=arch archisolabel=ARCH_201310"
memory = 512
disk = [ "phy:/dev/vg_centos6/archlinux,sda1,w", "file:/root/isos/arch/archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso,sdb,r" ]
vif = [ '' ]
</code></pre>

<p>After that, bring the DomU up by:</p>

<pre><code>mount /path/to/archlinux-2013.10.01-dual.iso /mnt/arch
cd /etc/xen/
xl create -c arch.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Install your Arch Linux as you like since it&rsquo;s really a highly customized distro.</p>

<h4>Fedora</h4>

<p>Again I got Fedora-20-Alpha-x86_64-netinst.iso by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/test/20-Alpha/Fedora/x86_64/iso/Fedora-20-Alpha-x86_64-netinst.iso
</code></pre>

<p>However, nightmares begin since I want to install it using the Debian way. <code>xl</code> just fails to boot normally but <code>virt-install</code> does the job.</p>

<p>Using the <code>virt-install</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>virt-install --virt-type xen -n fedora19 -r 512 --vcpus=2 -f /dev/vg_centos6/fedora19 --location http://mirrors.163.com/fedora/releases/19/Fedora/x86_64/os/ --os-type linux --accelerate --nographics --network=bridge:xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can download the ISO file first, then issuing your own httpd locally, thus making it:</p>

<pre><code>mount -o loop /path/to/fedora.iso /mnt/fedora
yum -y install httpd
service httpd start
ln -s /mnt/fedora /var/www/html
service iptables stop
virt-install --virt-type xen -n fedora19 -r 512 --vcpus=2 -f /dev/vg_centos6/fedora19 --location http://your.http.server.ip.address.here/ --os-type linux --accelerate --nographics --network=bridge:xenbr0
</code></pre>

<p>Remember this is for full Fedora installation, if you are using a netinst, you need to copy all the files to /var/www/html instead of creating a symbolic link and modify the .treeinfo file. No warrants here, since I did&rsquo;t try it myself.</p>

    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/10/09/sfd2013zhong-ke-yuan-zhan-huo-dong-xiao-jie</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>一年一度的SFD（自由软件日）活动顺利在中科院大学雁栖湖校区举行，由于今年情况特殊，中科院站的活动推迟到了9.28，而不是官方的9.21。而在9.21当天，中科院开源协会的成员一起去清华参加了TUNA和BJGUG联合举办的SFD。作为本次活动的组织者，简单从以下几个方面总结一下。</p>

<h2>什么是自由软件日（SFD）</h2>

<p>说到这个问题，不得不接着问“什么是自由软件？”。其中的历史就不再一一道来了，大家去<a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">SFD的官网</a>看个究竟吧-:)</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>关于SFD中科院站</h2>

<p>开源协会本着“自由，开放，分享”的精神，每年都会承办SFD。关于2013年活动的具体信息以及日程安排，请参考我们开源协会在SFD官网注册的活动<a href="http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/2013/China/Beijing/OSCLUB-CAS">wiki页面</a>。</p>

<h2>活动现场</h2>

<p>在Registration环节，实际注册人数为80左右，根据现场情况，到场的人数在100+。参加活动的主要为中科院大学的研一新生（包括开源协会的成员），还有TUNA，Fedora社区，BJGUG社区,北航开源俱乐部的一些朋友。</p>

<p>下面以Topic为主线简单介绍一下活动现场。</p>

<hr />

<h3>自由软件大观-李瑞彬</h3>

<p>Robin是一位程序员，Fedora 项目贡献者，致力于提高开源软件质量和宣传自由软件文化。</p>

<p>Robin首先就“自由软件的基本点”开始跟大家探讨，帮助大家理解“自由软件的特点”以及“什么是自由？”。之后非常详细地给出了“流行的自由软件”列表，对于想使用自由软件的同学是一个非常好的引导。最后Robin向大家介绍了“社区文化”并鼓励大家“参与到社区中来”。</p>

<hr />

<h3>HTML5应用开发与FirefoxOS平台介绍-袁徐磊</h3>

<p>袁徐磊毕业于清华大学计算机系，现工作于北京谋智网络技术有限公司,Firefox OS工程师，负责Firefox OS WebAPI的开发。</p>

<p>袁徐磊先生代表火狐中国给大家带来了关于“FirefoxOS平台以及HTML5”的主题演讲。袁先生首先介绍了一下“火狐中国”以及“Firefox浏览器”的基本情况，现场统计“Firefox”的使用率非常高，其丰富的插件也使其“如虎添翼”，得到使用者的称道。</p>

<p>后来进入技术主题，袁先生主要就“Firefox OS架构”，“WebAPI列表”，“App开发”，“开源环境与工具”给大家带来了分享，深入浅出地在短短30分钟的时间里把大家带入了“Firefox OS”的世界。后来的互动环节，提问者非常踊跃，提问环节也是对Topic没有提到的细节的一个很好的补充。</p>

<p>火狐同来的工程师还有尤睿先生，在QA环节帮助大家解答疑惑。</p>

<p>目前Firefox OS正在紧锣密鼓的开发中，感兴趣的同学不妨投身到社区中，贡献自己的一份力量-:)</p>

<hr />

<h3>浅谈云计算及其关键技术-白清杰</h3>

<p>白清杰先生是一名资深开源人士，前北京GNOME用户组负责人之一。cloudstack中国
社区管理员，2011年创建公司北京开源愿景信息技术有限公司，提供云计算解决
方案，公司是中国开源云联盟成员之一。</p>

<p>云计算目前被业界普遍认为是未来的发展趋势。
那么云计算究竟是什么？它有哪些特点？为什么云计算被业界普遍看好？
云计算和我们有什么关系？其中又有哪些关键技术？</p>

<p>白清杰先生先从“开源”说起，“没有开源就没有我们现在的互联网时代和云计算时代”，之后以“思维导图”的形式向大家展开叙述“云计算”。从“什么是云计算”到“云计算的特点”，再到“云计算的关键技术”，白先生以清晰的思路跟大家分享了他对“云计算”的认识。</p>

<p>白先生的Topic信息量很大。对于没有接触过“云计算”的同学，这是一个很好的入门。已经对“云计算”有了一定了解的同学，这是一次“梳理思路”的好机会。</p>

<hr />

<h3>自由软件的趋势与挑战及NITE-LPI联合认证项目-龙文选</h3>

<p>龙文选先生目前在黑鸭子软件担任企业开源战略咨询师，帮助国内大中型软件企业制定和实施软件开源的战略和流程。</p>

<p>龙先生主要跟大家分享了“自由软件现状，趋势及挑战”和“NITE-LPI联合认证项目”。</p>

<p>从“自由开源软件”讲起，描述了“Linux简史”，“Linux在国内的企业成功案例”以及“自由软件和Linux对全球软件行业的强力驱动”。越来越多的企业开始采用Linux，开始接受社区式的开发方式，缺乏Linux和自由软件人才已经逐渐成为公司的主要挑战之一，这也是“NITE-LPI联合认证项目”的切入点。</p>

<p>此“联合认证”的目的是全面推进Linux人才培养体系的建设，龙先生就项目的背景，LPI介绍，现状，高校和企业合作，LPI认证考试等给大家带来了分享。</p>

<p>龙先生的演讲带领大家从大局认识开源和Linux世界，对于致力于成为Linux人才的同学是一个很好的启发。</p>

<h2>活动总结</h2>

<p>本次活动，从邀请嘉宾，到活动安排以及现场的布置和协调，历时近一个月（由于今年研一新生搬到了怀柔的雁栖湖校区，情况比较特殊）。</p>

<p>由于从北京市过去雁栖湖校区交通不便，给嘉宾的日程协调带来了诸多不便，而活动当天的到场嘉宾都很给力，演讲内容丰富而精彩，非常感谢他们！活动地点选在雁栖湖校区，也是考虑到SFD的主要受众群体是研一新生，前期的宣传工作主要是海报的张贴，之后的活动可以考虑更加新颖的宣传方式。</p>

<p>活动现场出现了一些小环节的失误（教室的MIC数量没有协调好;教室没有激光笔，给嘉宾翻slides带来不便;嘉宾的演讲时间没有控制好，存在比较严重的超时），都是今后再次举办SFD需要改进的地方。另外，活动形式，除了演讲+QA，可以考虑一些新颖的形式，比如Hackfest，Installfest，圆桌讨论等等，毕竟SFD是为了让大家一起share的活动。</p>

<p>还有就是关于SFD官网的活动注册，今年比较晚申请，没能得到SFD的官方赞助，也是一个小小的遗憾。今后可以订阅SFD的mailing lists，及时注册活动并着手准备。</p>

<p>总得来说，本次活动比较成功，嘉宾和听众有了比较充分的沟通和互动，大家对“自由软件”，“开源”等进行了比较深入的探讨。</p>

<h2>致谢</h2>

<p>感谢各位演讲嘉宾，不辞辛苦地赶到怀柔给大家带来精彩的演讲！</p>

<p>感谢COPU，火狐中国以及LPI对开源协会一如既往的支持！</p>

<p>感谢各位sponsor，COPU，火狐中国，LPI，Deepin Linux以及GitCafe，谢谢你们慷慨赞助！</p>

<p>感谢友邻社区的大力支持，BJGUG，TUNA，Fedora社区以及北航开源俱乐部（很遗憾在活动现场没能跟大家打招呼）！</p>

<p>感谢开源协会的各位志愿者，是你们促成了本次活动的成功举行，协会的新成员都很给力，你们是协会的未来！</p>

<p>感谢活动的各位参与者，没有你们，本次活动会失色不少，希望你们都有所收获！</p>

<hr />

<p>SFD2014中科院站，大家再见！</p>

    <link href="http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/09/27/ptam-compilation-on-linux-howto/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-27T19:50:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/09/27/ptam-compilation-on-linux-howto</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The README.txt file shipped with the newest PTAM source code is really old (the cvs repositorys are gone for god&rsquo;s sake) ! I struggled to get it done on my Linux Mint 15 with totally failure:&ndash;(</p>

<p>However I made it with just pulling the bleeding edge libs(I mean TooN,libCVD and Gvars3) from github, add a header file <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> to <code>Tracker.cc</code>, edit the <code>Makefile</code> about the linker flags(I will tell the details below), and I absolutely think that &lsquo;share my experience to you&rsquo; is my duty.</p>

<p>I succeeded on <strong>Linux Mint 15</strong> and <strong>Ubuntu 12.04</strong>, other distros won&rsquo;t be hard either:&ndash;)</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Now, let&rsquo;s start the journey!</p>

<h2>Installation the required dependencies</h2>

<p><strong>Note the versions of the installed packages may differ from distros and versions of the same distro, just choose the ones suitable for you!</strong></p>

<h3>Build Tools</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config
</code></pre>

<h3>Boost for C++</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-doc
</code></pre>

<h3>Low level libraries for Linear Algebra</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libblas-dev
</code></pre>

<h3>Image I/O &amp;&amp; Camera Driver</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libdc1394-22-dev libv4l-dev 
</code></pre>

<h3>Video I/O &amp;&amp; Codec &amp;&amp; Display</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libpostproc-dev libswscale-dev libavdevice-dev libsdl-dev
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev 
</code></pre>

<h3>OpenGL</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev
</code></pre>

<h2>Installation of OpenCV</h2>

<pre><code>cd thePathYouWant
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/opencvlibrary/opencv-unix/2.4.6.1/opencv-2.4.6.1.tar.gz
tar zxvf opencv-2.4.6.1.tar.gz
cd opencv-2.4.6.1/
mkdir release 
cd release
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to alert the system about the new installed OpenCV libs,</p>

<pre><code>vi /etc/ld.so.conf
add `include /usr/local/lib`
sudo ldconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Do this if you mannualy install other libraries when running into problems(as libcvd and Gvars3 discussed below).</p>

<p>After this, <strong>OpenCV dependencies can now be linked with simply: <code>pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs</code></strong></p>

<p>Really cool, huh?</p>

<h2>Installation of TooN &amp;&amp; libCVD &amp;&amp; Gvars3</h2>

<p>You may want to get the source code by just pulling from github like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo " Now pulling TooN..."
git clone git://github.com/edrosten/TooN.git
echo " TooN done for good!"

echo " Now pulling libcvd..."
git clone git://github.com/edrosten/libcvd.git
echo " libcvd done for good!"

echo " Now pulling gvars3..."
git clone git://github.com/edrosten/gvars.git
echo " gvars3 done for good!"

echo " All done."
</code></pre>

<p>If this confuses you, just download the package like this:</p>

<pre><code>cd thePathYouWant
wget http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/TooN-2.1.tar.gz
wget http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/libcvd-20121025.tar.gz
wget http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/gvars-3.0.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note the versions may differ as time goes by, use git if you can</strong> Or just look at this <a href="http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/toon.html">link</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Also remember <strong>do refer to the README files when you try to install the libraries</strong>, cause they really do help in some manner:&ndash;)</p>

<h3>TooN</h3>

<p>Just header files, easy to install huh?</p>

<pre><code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h3>libCVD</h3>

<p>Remember that libCVD really needs TooN, or you will get stuck when trying to compile PTAM:&ndash;(</p>

<p>The steps I used is like this:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --without-ffmpeg --without-v4l1buffer --without-dc1394v1 --without-dc1394v2
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you run into problems, check the output of <code>./configure</code> carefully, they will give you some hints:&ndash;)</p>

<h3>Gvars3</h3>

<p>This is also easy, like this:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --disable-widgets
make
make install
</code></pre>

<h3>Make the libs work</h3>

<pre><code>sudo ldconfig
</code></pre>

<h2>Compilation of PTAM</h2>

<p>Now comes the real part of our journey, refer to the README.txt file for details.</p>

<h3>Copy the appropriate platform build files</h3>

<pre><code>cd PTAM
cp Build/Linux/* .
</code></pre>

<h3>Edit the Makefile to reference custom include or linker paths</h3>

<pre><code>LINKFLAGS = -L /usr/local/lib -lGvars3 -lcvd -lGLU -lGL -llapack
</code></pre>

<p><code>/usr/local/lib</code> is my custom linker path.</p>

<h3>Make the Video Source right</h3>

<ul>
<li>VideoSource_Linux_DV.cc</li>
<li>VideoSource_Linux_V4L.cc</li>
<li>VideoSource_Linux_Gstreamer_File.cc</li>
<li>VideoSource_Linux_OpenCV.cc</li>
</ul>


<p>The first two are for camera capturing and the last twos are shipped with <a href="https://github.com/BeLioN-github/PTAM">BeLioN-github/PTAM</a> and can be used to serve images from video files.</p>

<h3>Make</h3>

<p>Probably an error will popup, like &ldquo;error, <code>usleep</code> was not declared in this scope&rdquo;, easily add</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to <code>Tracker.cc</code> and you are done:&ndash;)</p>

<p>Just</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>and enjoy!</p>

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>Definitely special thanks will go to <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/">Georg Klein</a>, the author and PTAM! Good job, Georg!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>利用上个周末的两天时间，参加了“阿里技术大讲堂”，主题是“互联网营销技术”，各位讲师都是“阿里妈妈”的人，且个个身怀绝技。个人虽然对这个领域很陌生，但还是跑去参加了，一是想领略一下阿里的技术，而是想感受一下阿里的人。现在想想，不虚此行，用一篇小结整理一下学到的东西，梳理自己思路的同时，希望能给大家带来些有效信息。</p>

<hr />

<h2>认识下P4P</h2>

<p>搜索P4P得到比较多的检索结果是一种基于P2P的传输技术，全称为<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactive_network_Provider_Participation_for_P2P">Proactive network provider participation for P2P</a>。而在广告领域，需要解释为Pay for Performance，遗憾的是没能在维基百科上找到权威定义，不过各大电商和互联网公司的推广和广告系统，都会提到P4P这个词。想了解更多，搜索“淘宝P4P”或者“阿里巴巴P4P”会得到一些有效信息。一言以蔽之，就是“高效而精准的广告投放”。</p>

<!--more-->


<hr />

<h2>技术专场要点</h2>

<p>两天的课程一直在做笔记，先面根据课程先后把一些要点分享出来，不会特别详细，给出一些关键词，感兴趣的可以自己查阅资料展开学习！</p>

<hr />

<h3>互联网营销概述-云雀</h3>

<p>广告投放的计费方式分为，cpt/cpc/cps/cpa/cpm等，具体解释可以参考<a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_68d723030100xwwg.html">CPM CPT CPC CPA CPS在网络营销中是什么意思？</a>.</p>

<p>互联网营销的参与方，商家，User，Publisher，营销平台，其中“平台”是所有参与者的纽带，有了“平台”，其它玩家才有得玩。把参与方搞清楚，对于理解后续的整个营销平台架构很关键。</p>

<p>目前主要的营销产品形式：</p>

<ul>
<li>Sponsored Search</li>
</ul>


<p>目前最核心的收益来源，竞价逻辑采用GSP（Generalized Second Price），但是面临一些问题。</p>

<ul>
<li>定向营销</li>
</ul>


<p>比如Google Adsense，百度网盟，技术上使用cookie实现。</p>

<ul>
<li>展示营销</li>
</ul>


<p>属于non-guaranteed类型的营销。</p>

<ul>
<li>RTB（Real Time Biding）</li>
</ul>


<p>即实时竞价，实现的核心系统是Ad Exchange Server。</p>

<hr />

<h3>大规模高并发的营销系统架构-超明</h3>

<p>主要讲了查询系统和更新系统，其中实时更新采用Storm实时流式计算系统，而全量更新采用Hadoop分布式计算系统。</p>

<p>在业务逻辑方面，主要讲述了：</p>

<ul>
<li>出价与竞价体系（GSP）</li>
<li>过滤（实现个性化投放）</li>
<li>Bucket机制（不同算法和策略的验证）</li>
<li>插件化（框架与业务分离，不同业务解耦合）</li>
<li>ranking模型（漏斗式，由简单到复杂）</li>
<li>分级查询（分布式）</li>
<li>实时数据采集</li>
<li>数据分发</li>
<li>大数据（Hadoop，Storm，MPI）</li>
<li>分离（数据节点与检索节点分离）</li>
<li>移步处理（未来的方向，目前正在尝试中）</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>搜索营销触发技术-翔羽</h3>

<p>也就是搜索营销的Matching技术，主要解决的问题：</p>

<ul>
<li>用户查询意图理解</li>
<li>推广语义，信息扩充</li>
<li>用户和客户信息不对称和流量分配</li>
</ul>


<p>三段式架构下的技术问题分解：</p>

<ul>
<li>Query改写</li>
</ul>


<p>主要是Query分析，改写和相似度计算。</p>

<ul>
<li>Bid-Ads</li>
</ul>


<p>包括Ads分析，Bid-Ads索引优化，Bid-Ads排序。</p>

<ul>
<li>初选</li>
</ul>


<p>Matching的不同levels，Term-Phrase-Word Sense-Topic-Structure，典型的NLP吧。</p>

<p>最后讲了一下模糊匹配。</p>

<hr />

<h3>搜索营销中的点击率预估：算法和系统-治平</h3>

<p>创意排序和ECPM排序中的核心问题是CTR预估，即点击率预估，解决的方法是大规模机器学习。</p>

<p>主要的挑战包括，线下海量数据的处理，线下服务的高并发，QPS达到了1W-10W级别，实时性在1ms！</p>

<p>未来努力的方向还是个性化和实时化！</p>

<hr />

<h3>行为定向技术-王睿</h3>

<p>深入检出，幽默风趣，是王总的风格，说的话几乎句句是干货。</p>

<p>定向算法需要解决的问题，本质上，是对创意信息，浏览者信息和场景信息的排序。</p>

<p>两个Query如何比较相似性？（根据Query对应的商品计算）。</p>

<p>后来讲到了定向维度（裸数据的维度达到了千亿的级别，预处理之后是十亿的级别，好吓人）和RTB，可能听得比较起劲，记得东西少了:&ndash;(。</p>

<hr />

<h3>展示营销技术-Tanx架构-澄观</h3>

<p>主要就阿里妈妈研发的Tanx系统展开，首先还是缕清楚参与方，具体交互可以参考<img src="http://contest.ipinyou.com/cn/images/tw.jpg" alt="下图" />。</p>

<p>而ADX市场，主要分析了Google，Tecent，Baidu和Ali。</p>

<p>系统架构方面，主要包括：</p>

<ul>
<li>用户交互</li>
<li>推广计划</li>
<li>管理系统</li>
<li>Business Platform(BP)</li>
<li>ECPM Tanx</li>
<li>Logs</li>
<li>Algorithms</li>
<li>Reports</li>
</ul>


<p>具体技术的展开：</p>

<ul>
<li>bidrequest包含的信息</li>
</ul>


<p>浏览者信息，网页信息，创意信息。</p>

<ul>
<li>QPS控制</li>
</ul>


<p>DSP的系统负载能力各不相同;QPS可以控制到分钟的粒度;基于DSP的错误率，QPS自动调整;集群机器的扩展和临时缩减控制。</p>

<ul>
<li>大流量高并发通信技术</li>
</ul>


<p>竞价流量规模翻N倍;减少网络通信量，压缩，托管等;挖掘单机极致吞吐量和连接数libevent和nginx的灵活应用。</p>

<ul>
<li>Cookie Mapping</li>
</ul>


<p>从安全角度出发，Cookie不能跨域共享，将不同域的不同ID关联起来，就形成了Cookie Mapping技术。具体设计到几十亿的KV存储（采用Tair引擎），Cookie的托管服务以及DSP流量预选。</p>

<h3>展示营销的定向算法与竞价算法介绍-芍药</h3>

<p>特别活泼可爱的一个讲师，讲解的思路很清晰。</p>

<p>首先还是从大面上认识一下，非搜索广告 VS. 搜索广告，展示营销的特点，展示营销的分类（Guaranteed Delivery &amp;&amp; Non-Guaranteed Delivery）。</p>

<p>在关于展示营销系统的参与方的讲解上，通过对三方（媒体，客户，用户）进行属性的描述非常直观。</p>

<p>定向算法这边，主要是分类，采用了SVM，解决的问题就是如何选择用户兴趣点的维度以及怎么样将用户和其兴趣点关联。</p>

<p>而竞价算法解决的是，如何在不同的位置，给不同的用户展示合适的广告？这里又是Tanx解决的问题了，主要用到的技术就是HDFS，Map/Reduce，MPI。</p>

<p>而在客户工具这里，阿里也越来越关注流量提供方和广告投放方，毕竟他们才是拿钱的主啊:&ndash;)</p>

<h3>DSP系统架构-墨魂</h3>

<p>DSP（Demand-Side Platform），即需求方平台。</p>

<p>实时定向系统架构：</p>

<ul>
<li>投放平台</li>
<li>特征扩展</li>
<li>信息检索</li>
</ul>


<p>这里讲得比较多，主要有倒排，and和or查询，迭代查询机制，Cache机制，数据更新机制。</p>

<ul>
<li>实时竞价</li>
</ul>


<p>Tanx again。</p>

<h3>RTB技术介绍-则成</h3>

<p>虽然是纯技术，但是这一讲很有意思。</p>

<ul>
<li>Why RTB？</li>
</ul>


<p>实时竞价，是一种利用第三方技术在数以百万计的网站上针对每一个用户展示行为进行评估以及出价的竞价技术。</p>

<ul>
<li>RTB Mechanisms</li>
</ul>


<p>在几十个毫秒内，找对人，投对商品。</p>

<p>大概步骤：</p>

<p>   1.用户访问网页</p>

<p>   2.流量竞拍要求</p>

<p>   3.海量用户数据进行价值判断与出价</p>

<p>   4.广告交易市场竞拍</p>

<p>   5.获得广告位投放机会</p>

<ul>
<li>RTB的特点</li>
</ul>


<p>   1.粒度为每个PV级别的拍卖</p>

<p>   2.交易平台以CPM方式向获胜DSP收费</p>

<p>   3.Vickrey拍卖（封闭拍卖，价高者得，第二价格扣费）</p>

<p>   4.对每个bidder，最优策略是按照自己对商品的价值来报价（后来的理论分析很优美）</p>

<ul>
<li>Bidding Algorithms</li>
</ul>


<p>   1.md6.com（DSP公司）的竞价算法</p>

<p>   2.Yahoo的Bid Star Tree</p>

<p>   3.Alimama的报价模型之一，Golden Filter</p>

<h3>推荐技术及在营销推广中的应用-小致</h3>

<p>讲得很技术，pure technical.</p>

<p>首先介绍了淘宝数据，按照“行为”，“场景”和“内容信息”分类。</p>

<p>之后进入正题，开始讲“推荐算法”。涵盖的内容：</p>

<ul>
<li>Item CF（协同过滤）</li>
</ul>


<p>主要说到了Jaccard/ModJaccard以及Cosine/WbCosine。</p>

<ul>
<li>内容相似度</li>
</ul>


<p>Minhash，解决“冷启动”的问题。</p>

<ul>
<li>融合算法</li>
</ul>


<p>模拟退火，单纯形，GBDT/LR之类的。</p>

<p>评价指标主要提到了Auc，Recall，Coverage，都是机器学习的东西了。</p>

<p>最后的推荐形式，讲了“相似推荐”，“搭配推荐”和“实时推荐”。</p>

<hr />

<h2>总结</h2>

<p>两天的课程，算是对互联网营销入了门。对很多专业术语有了了解，对现有的系统架构有了皮毛的认识，而对于机器学习，数据挖掘，自然语言处理的威力有了更加清晰的定位。在“做东西的过程中学习”，是现在非常赞成的“学习方法”，虽然两天的技术讲堂没有“做东西”，但是来自一线的阿里讲师们，用自己的实际经历将心得传授给大家，也是一种非常好的学习方式！感谢阿里在技术讲堂上的努力，阿里高校技术联盟今年也开始在计算所试点了（自动化所明年应该会到位），感谢各位讲师！</p>

<p>无意中发现了一个RTB的比赛，链接在<a href="http://contest.ipinyou.com/cn/index.shtml">这里</a>，感兴趣的同学不妨一试:&ndash;)</p>
