After being the reviewer for the [BeagleBone Robotic Projects](http://hustcalm.me/blog/2014/02/10/review-of-beaglebone-robotic-projects-from-a-technical-perspective/), I'm honored to be the reviewer for another book about robotic projects named [Raspberry Pi Robotic Projects](http://bit.ly/1hrlCQP). I will go no further to talk about the differences about `BeagleBone` and `Raspberry Pi`, all I know is that they are both cool and amazing. To start to play with `Raspberry Pi`, I suggest that you
can list the book [Raspberry Pi Robotics Projects](http://bit.ly/1hrlCQP) as an option.

In this post, I will give you a very quick overview of the book and tell why it's worth it.

#### Getting Started with Raspberry Pi

Have no idea what is really `Raspberry Pi`? Well, just treat it as your `Mini Computer`. The truth is, it got almost everything what a PC should be equipped with. What's more, it runs Linux which means you can do tons of things with it!

Yes, yes, `Raspberry Pi` is leading the `open hardware community` somehow, people design, manufacture, develop and play. Geeks use it for their geek life!

In **chapter 1**, you will be informed the hardware and software of `Raspberry Pi` and begin to be friends with her.

#### Programming Raspberry Pi

As you want to make `Raspberry Pi` do something really amazing, you should know how to talk to her. Well, you program to talk. So in **chapter 2**, we will show you how to get comfortable with the way `talking(programming)`. Besides to knowing `Linux`, use `Python` and `C/C++` is cool:-)

#### Providing Speech Input and Output

What? You want to talk to her, really. I mean by `speaking`. Well, that should not be problem. Let's give our robot `ears` and `mouth`. **Chapter 3** will show you how to use `PocketSphinx` to accept your voice commands and utilize `Espeak` to make `Raspberry Pi` talk in a robot voice.

#### Adding Vision to Raspberry Pi

How can a beautiful girl be blind! So to make `Rasberry Pi` see the amazing world, **chapter 4** will tell you how to connect the USB cemara to `Raspberry Pi` and begin to use `OpenCV`, which is a fully featured vision library to detect colored objects.

#### Creating Mobile Robots on Wheels

Let's roll! To see the beatiful world around, we need to make our robot able to move. **Chapter 5** will show you how to add motor controller to `Raspberry Pi` and let her run at free will.

#### Making the Unit Very Mobile - Controlling the Movement of a Robot with Legs

A girl should really walk, doesn't it? No problem, **chapter 6** tells how to get started with `servos` and make your mobile platform truly mobile just as a person.

#### Avoiding Obstacles Using Sensors

Oh, there is a wall in front, danger! Don't worry, our `Raspberry Pi` knows everything and will avoid it easily. **Chapter 7** shows how to use an `infrared sensor` and `USB sonar sensor` with `Raspberry Pi`, also how to use a `servo` to move a single sensor to make our sening range large enough.

#### Going Truly Mobile - The Remote Control of Your Robot

You will not always be around with your `Raspberry Pi`, right? To make sure your `Pi` is always with you, **Chapter 8** demonstrates how to connect wireless devices to `Pi` thus enabling us to talk to her remotely. Use a `wireless USB keyboard`, or `a wireless LAN` or `a ZigBee device`, choose as you like.

#### Using a GPS Receiver to Locate Your Robot

No one wants to be told that his `Raspberry Pi` is lost. Fortunately, we got `GPS` nowadays for almost free. Connecting `Raspberry Pi` to a `GPS` device and accessing the `GPS` programmatically is mainly covered in **chapter 9**.

#### System Dynamics

Get tired with so much coding for each dedicated task? **Chaper 10** will free you from hell by creating a general control structure. Also you can enable complex functionalities by using the structure of the `Robot Operating System`.

#### By Land, Sea, and Air

Maybe you don't just want a `Raspbery Pi`, you really want is a `Quadrotor`, or a `submarine` or a `mini ship`! Nothing is impossible, **Chapter 11** will be a good starting point to creat something really amazing.

I hope that you like `Raspberry Pi` and the book will do some good. Happy playing and hakcing with `Raspberry Pi`!!!
