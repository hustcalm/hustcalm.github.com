I happened to get to know `Google Webmaster Tools`, `Google Analytics` and `Google Authorship Markup` when I try to tweak my `Octopress` website. Found that Google is really doing lots of interesting things for our websites, I will share some useful tips and links here.

------------------------------
### Google Webmaster Tools

Go to [Official Webmasters](http://www.google.com/webmasters/) to get started, first try to look around to know what `Webmasters` aims to do. After that, login to [Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools) , add your website by clicking `Add Website`, then verify the website according to the hints.

As long as you have claimed the owership of your website, you can see the dashboard for detailed information. You can submit your `sitemap`, see the `search query` statistics, the status of your website. 

Explore more to find something more exciting:-) 

To be more professional, see [Webmaster Guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en).

------------------------------
### Google Analytics
Even better, [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) will let you know every single click from users to your website. See [Analytics features](http://www.google.com/analytics/features/index.html) for complete lists to know what `Analytics` can do. Initially set up for commercial use or marketing promotion, we can adapt this technique to our personal website.

Also, look carefully about `your website report`, I bet you will find something interesting. For developers, there are [Developer Guides & Reference for Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/?csw=1).

------------------------------
### Google Authorship

Well, it would be cool to attribute the article or post to its author, [Google Authorship](https://plus.google.com/authorship) is the one who helps.

See the professional article [The Definitive Guide To Google Authorship Markup](http://searchengineland.com/the-definitive-guide-to-google-authorship-markup-123218) for details. To test if you have successfully set your authorship, use [Google Structured Data Testing
Tool](www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets).

As for me, I verified my authorship through my Email related to my domain bought from [name.com](https://name.com). Simple Enable `Email Service` through the domain dashboard, you can set up a forward Email for your owned domain Email address.

------------------------------
### Google FeedBurner
[FeedBurner](http://feedburner.google.com) is a service for `RSS` subscribe. It's flexible enough and ease your pain when switching domains.

After you add your blog to feedburner, it supports `RSS readers` by default. So if you want your readers to subscribe through their Emails, go to your feeds and click `Publicize`, then click `Email Subscriptions`, down the page to click `Active` to make the service alive.

See other tabs of your feeds, there are really lots of for you to tweak and play with.

------------------------------
When you find blogging more interesting and part of your life, it's time to give an eye for your website status and traffic. I used to blog for just expressing myself, but now I also tend to write something that readers would enjoy.

Hope this post would get you to know with the Google tools that you can use and make you a better blogger:-)
