People will always find themselves making varies of slides for demo or promotion or report, whatever. Most would know how to make a slide ,right? `PPT` would be the first choice to majority of people. For web developers, they would produce their slides in `HTML + CSS + Javascript`? And for researchers or people in academic area, will they use `Latex` or the popular `beamer` class?

We do have kinds of approaches to make us slids work, but what is the awesome way? To be awesome, I mean the sides should look nice, easy to control its typeset and should maintain the same when playing at different devices or different software. Of course, the way to write your slide could be awesome too:-)

I will simply go through what choices that we have, what's the advantage disadvantage, and finally choose the way that you think is awesome to you.

------------------------------
### Choices for making slides

#### The normal way - PPT

#### Cool way utilizing browser - HTML + CSS

#### Awesome way using Latex - beamer

------------------------------
### Awesome way for making slides

To me, the awesome would be to use `HTML + CSS` or `beamer`. Why? Simply because they are cross platform naturely and it's really flexible when creating slides by writing plain markup files or something like that.

------------------------------
### Choose your awesome way

Most of the times, you will find the ways or methods are not the essential things, the contents and the way you represent is the key. So just choose the right way for you, making it your awesome way. I believe everyone will make a perfect job once he gets skillful enough.
